_I saved every tip that I could that was shared from my_ [_January Zero Spend Challenge_](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-do-a-zero-spend-month-that-works-for-you/) _and posted them all below!_

1\. **Find a credit card that has cashback or rewards** and use it often to pay for things, but remember to never carry a balance or it wouldn't be helpful at all!

2\. **Create "off limits" lists**, especially when wanting to save extra during [zero spend months](https://www.simplehomemom.com/3-surprising-things-a-zero-spend-month-will-tell-you-about-yourself/): i.e. books, stationary, takeout, clothing, Starbucks, beauty products, etc.
