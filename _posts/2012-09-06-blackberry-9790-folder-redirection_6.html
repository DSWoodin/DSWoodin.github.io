I am unable to setup folder redirection, the option does not exist.<br/><br/>If you are unable to see the Folder Redirection option you need to enable the "Wireless Reconcile" option.<br/>Basically the "folder redirection" option disappears when the "wireless reconciliation" option is unticked - turn it on and the Folder Redirection appears.<br/><br/>Within your messages click the blackberry button &gt; Options<br/><br/>Email Reconciliation &gt; Make sure the "Wireless Reconcile" option is ticked.<br/><br/>Then Folder redirection can be setup as follows:<br/>Within messages click the blackberry button &gt; Options &gt; email preferences<br/><br/>Then press the Blackberry button again &gt; Select Folder Redirection
