Someone may ask you how to write a good bug report that can make the developer happy. In fact, there is no such thing as a bug report, no matter how beautifully written it is, which can make a developer happy.
Writing an accurate bug report is crucial, and it will increase your chances of fixing any bugs you find. Writing effective bug reports is not that difficult, you just need a good pattern and some practice. Remember that preparing a good bug report is the primary responsibility of a successful software tester.

Let's see the reality now! In most cases, you will use a bug tracking tool that simplifies the process of writing a bug report, as it automatically fills in some information as a reporter or issue number. If you do not use any such tool, you will need to enter this information manually.

What is the expected behavior in your case? Expected results are usually related to customer requirements and predetermined.

# Achieved / Actual Results:

In your case that was actually the behavior (results)? Write the actual behavior of the bug.

An image is worth a thousand words. Take the right screenshot or screencast and capture this annoying bug!

# Additional, but very important information you should provide:

- The user credentials with which you created the bug.
- Problem field / URL.
- Product version (if applicable).
- The browser you used, especially in case of design problems.

# Severity

Priority - It depends on the severity of the bug. The most serious bugs should be fixed first.

- [ ] Blocker: No more tests can be performed.
- [ ] Critical: Application crashes, data loss.
- [ ] Major: Big loss of function.
- [ ] Minor: Minor loss of work.
- [ ] Trivial: small, UI error.
