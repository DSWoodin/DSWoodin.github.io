[Giuspen's FOSS CherryTree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/). Program is pretty fast, and makes it very easy to take notes in a hierarchical fashion. You can copy/paste images, insert Code Blocks, italic, bold, hyperlinks, etc.

It even smartly-parses the contents of web pages, so you can just copy a whole page and it'll look just as it did on the web. good stuff

And if you're very tech-savy, consider making your own 'Tasks.org + (Radicale w/ InfCloud GUI)/Self-Hosted NextCloud' setup. Makes it easy to create "tasks" (reminders) that can have links, voice notes, locations, notes, sub-tasks, etc.

hope this helps ;p
