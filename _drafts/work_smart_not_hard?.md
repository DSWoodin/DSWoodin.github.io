 >You gotta dig and trust that by putting in the effort you wonâ€™t be digging for nothing!

This quote was more towards balance. The bird never digs for a worm, the worm also never jumps into the birds mouth. Why dig for a worm when you can time things right and know when they are lying around on the ground? Also, that worm wont crawl into your mouth, so you still have to take it, just take it easy. Work smart not hard, know your limits and find a balance that suits your nature. Just like the bird does.
