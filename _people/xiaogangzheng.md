# Bio
Xiaogang Zheng, Postdoctoral fellow at the Astrophysics Center of Wuhan University, research mainly focuses on cosmology. The specific research contents list as follows: using the measurement of Hubble parameters for the cosmological model test, compare the observational measurements with the theoretical model through the two-point diagnosis method. Using the newest catalog of galaxy clusters, combined with an empirical relation between the total mass and the gas mass fraction and based on non-parametric reconstruction using the measurements of Hubble parameters from cosmic chronometers, to investigate the possible redshift evolution of the gas depletion factor. Studying the validity of cosmic distance duality relation through the combination of luminosity distances derived from the relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity of quasars and the angular diameter distances obtained from the compact structure in inter-mediate-luminosity radio quasars.
