 Liz Hand is amazing!

I haven't been a juror for a long time. JoAnn Cox does the lionshare of the administration work but I help out behind the scenes, supporting the jurors and such. I'm so pleased you've found books that you like via the awards. 

Personally, I always wanted the awards to promote the idea that horror is a big and healthy genre. By big, I mean there's a lot more works of horror being published than the ones that have horror written on the spine. I like that it's really up to each year's 5 jurors to decide what should be recognized. We administrators never step in and say no to a jury choice (unless the work in question isn't eligible because of year published, etc). 

A deep cut nominee that I loved and would've love to have given an award was Michael Cisco's The Traitor.
