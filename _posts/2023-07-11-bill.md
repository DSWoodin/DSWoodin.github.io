After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I'm semi-retired but still good for the smaller stuff.

 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Fit shelving
 - Fix kitchen cabinets
 - Lay tiles
 - Silicone a bath or sink
 - Repair damaged walls or plasterboard
 - Clean up and re-paint a radiator
 
These are just examples. If you need something else I can probably give you a quote.

There are jobs that I won't take on:
  - Longer jobs (more than 3 days)
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing (not even tap washers)
  - Double-glazed window or door systems
  - Extensive exterior painting
  - Extensive flooring work
