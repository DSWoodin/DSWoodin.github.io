I've been looking after animals for years, mostly for long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.


#### Pet Sitting
My husband Bill and I will look after your pets in your home. Recently we've mostly cared for dogs but in the past we've cared for several generations of customers' cats.

Before starting an animal sit we'll visit to get to know your pet and in the case of a dog, join you on a walk.

We don't take animals into our own home and we are not dog walkers. Looking after your pet at home reduces stress and gives us the opportunity to form a great relationship withto  at home reduces stress allows me and Bill to forming a relatiuonship with your dog


 - Pet Sitting costs Â£35 per day or part of day:
 - We sleep overnight in your house, bringing our own bedding.
 - At least one of us remains with your pet for most of the day.
 - Dogs get walked up to twice a day.
 - We bring our own food.
 - We leave your house in the same state we found it.

We can only sit one house at a time and are sometimes continuously booked, so please contact me well in advance.
