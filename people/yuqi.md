I am Yuqi Zheng, a PhD student in Lukas KÃ¤ll's group at the Department of Gene Technology, CBH School, KTH, majoring in Biotechnology. My research lies in the field of computational proteomics.  Specifically, I dedicate my efforts to developing and applying statistical and machine learning methods to make proteoform inferences from mass spectrometry data, thereby deepening our understanding of the intricate dynamics of the proteome and its impact on human health. If you are interested in delving deeper into my research, discussing potential collaborations, or looking to connect, please don't hesitate to contact me at [yuqizh@kth.se](mailto:yuqizh@kth.se). I look forward to exploring new perspectives and opportunities in the fascinating world of proteomics.
