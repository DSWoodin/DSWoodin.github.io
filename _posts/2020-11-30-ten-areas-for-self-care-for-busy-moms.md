Do you pencil in your "self care"? And by "self care", I mean, the things that fill you up spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about ten areas of self care for busy moms to consider penciling into your routine as well as a look into what I pencil in on the regular.   
  
A while back, I shared about how I started to pencil in my weekly bath nights and shower days. There were years there as mom that I often had no clue the last time I had a shower..(I mean, I had a basic idea, but it's something I had to actively think about, you know?). 

## Ten areas of self care for busy moms to consider penciling into your routine

  
1\. Spiritual self care - spiritual reading, bible study, podcast listening, prayer, spiritual music, book study  
2\. Mental care - stimulating conversations, readings, growing/thinking, taking a course  
3\. Physical self care - move your body, rest your body, get a bath type stuff, eating healthier etc.  
4\. Nature - get outside, breathe deeply, notice and breathe in nature  
5\. Audio self care - Taking a break from noise or listening to beautiful music.  
6\. Imagination - read a thought provokifiction book.   
7\. Creativity  
8\. Relationship  
9\. Duties done with love  
10\. Routines - what needs work? Waking up earlier, getting in your daily prayer time, eating healthy, and so on

And there's something to be said about actually writing things down that helps us to commit it to memory and to our lives. It has a higher chance of sticking. 

  
**_Some of what my pencilled in self care looks like now:_**

* Saturday bath night + podcasts PS listen to [Make Joy Normal](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/id1512837291) for your weekly bath night, featuring yours truly this week! 
* Friday night veg out night
* Getting out for a jaunt in nature 3x a week
* Calling a friend once a week
* Reading a fiction book at least 2x a week
* Morning prayer in peace + 3x a week a spiritual book and/or podcast
* A day "off" every few weeks. My husband and I switch off every couple of weeks. We started this a couple months ago and it's been working really nicely.   
  Daily quiet time for myself and the kids... I often rest or work here depending on what I need day to day. 

It's a noisy life. It's a noisy home with three boys and a toddler girl, and my goodness, it's so easy for time to slip by and the day happen to to me without thinking about it. Penciling in these kinds of things makes it more likely that these things will happen. 

_PS Needing more of a plan to get you more motivated for some self care time? I found a list of twenty other ideas for self care ideas for moms. If you’d like, send me an email at_ [_simplehomemom@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _and I’d be happy to send you that list!_
