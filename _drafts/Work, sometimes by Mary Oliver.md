I was sad all day, and why not. There I was, books piled 

on both sides of the table, paper stacked up, words

falling off my tongue.

​

The robins had been a long time singing, and now it

was beginning to rain.

​

What are we sure of? Happiness isn't a town on a map,

or an early arrival, or a job well done, but good work

ongoing. Which is not likely to be the trifling around

with a poem.

​

Then it began raining hard, and the flowers in the yard

were full of lively fragrance.

​

You have had days like this, no doubt. And wasn't it

wonderful, finally, to leave the room? Ah, what a 

moment!

​

As for myself, I swung the door open. And there was 

the wordless, singing world. And I ran for my life.
