<br>I am currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am dual-enrolled as an undergraduate senior and first year master's student.
I am a candidate in the Robotics Master's Program, with a focus in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.  For my undergraduate degree, I study 
Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM), with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.  I have gained a strong background in these
fields throughout my undergraduate studies, while also discovering that research is the perfect outlet for me to apply my knowledge and skills.  
Recently, both my research and academics have been focused on Computer Vision.  See my coursework and projects sections for more details!<br>

<br>
Robotics and AI are my passions, so hopefully this website provides a platform for me to flex some of my projects, as well as my interests.
