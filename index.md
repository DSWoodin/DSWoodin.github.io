**I am** an Assistant professor at McMaster University in the 


**I am** a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto in professor [Alan Aspuru-Guzik's group](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/). I am also an associate postdoctoral researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/about/).
I did my PhD in professor [R. Krems' group](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/krems/) at the University of British Columbia, and I was a postdoctoral researcher from 2019 to 2021 in professor [P. Brumer's group](https://www.chemistry.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/paul-brumer). The main topic of my research has been the application of machine learning to simulate many-body physics.

**My current research topics are** applications of *automatic differentiation* for many-body physics, for example, applications to quantum chemistry, and the optimization of energy transport systems under natural light. I also worked in constructing of more accurate *potential energy surfaces* using Gaussian processes.

**I was born** in Mexico city, and I lived a couple of years in Vancouver during my graduate studies. In the summer of 2019, I moved to Toronto to continue my academic carrear. 
In my spare time I usually practice *bike&beer* or *cafe&cletas*, choose a craft brewery or a coffee shop and cycle there. Before the pandemic I used to play basketball too.
