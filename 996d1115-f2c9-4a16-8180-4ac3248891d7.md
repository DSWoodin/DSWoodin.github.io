 Don't ever be loyal to a company. Work hard, do your job well, but do not treat a company like you are part of their family because you will get bit in the ass that way.  

I know you feel frustrated about your environment but you need to look out for yourself first. Document everything that bothers you about the climate you are in, and when you leave present it to HR. At some point if enough people are having the same issues then they may review what kind of environment they are providing for their employees. If you push back too hard now you will pay for it, the best thing you can do is keep your head down until you have something else lined up.  

On a positive note I just ordered two new pairs of yoga pants yesterday and can't wait to start tempting men by being comfortable in my apartment, eating tacos, and playing Steam games, haha. Try to control yourself fellas!
