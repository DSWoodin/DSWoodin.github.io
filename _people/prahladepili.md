# Bio

Dr. Prahlad R. Epili is a Post-doctoral researcher in the School of Physics and Technology (SPT), Wuhan University (WHU). During my PhD (2013-2018) in PRL, Ahmedabad, I have studied the spectral and timing variabilities of accretion powered X-ray pulsars, like Be/X-ray binaries, the compact star is a neutron star (NS, also a pulsar) orbiting the massive main-sequence star of B class spectral type in a close binary system. X-ray observations of these events with instruments on-board X-ray satellites such as Insight/HXMT, NuSTAR and Astrosat give us an opportunity to study the underlying emission mechanism in the vicinity of these sources. My main interest is to use these X-ray observations of accreting NS to understand the pulsar emission, specifically its geometry and its variations with X-ray luminosity. In WHU- SPT, I would be working with Prof. Wang Wei. We are going to use Insight/HXMT observations to study the spectral and timing variabilities of various accreting NS sources in binary systems to address the pulsar emission beam patterns and its variations with luminosity.
