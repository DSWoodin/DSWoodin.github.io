Minimal living and wardrobes for kids? How does that even work? We have four kids so, I mean, that’s a lot of kids, so it’s going to be a lot of clothes even with minimal wardrobes. But we’ve learned steps that have certainly helped. On the blog today I’m sharing four steps to create minimal wardrobes for kids.

## Pick your number

Pick a number for each category of clothing that works for you and your kids. Keep in mind how often you do laundry, how often they soil their clothing. For our kids, for most areas, they have 3-4 items (tees, long sleeves, shorts, etc). I also have one to two items for their “dressier clothes” aka button down shirts and jeans or a dress for our toddler.

## Choose quality

Choosing better quality clothing will help their wardrobes last longer, essentially. I like to focus on quality and colour. Dark colours preferred over lights and good quality over lower quality that will easily pill, rip, or stain. I prefer either high quality natural or athletic wear fabrics as both hold up very well for our kids.

## Decluttering and maintaining the wardrobe

Remove items that no longer fit, work, or are unfixable now and as they pop up. I’m often given hand me downs, so will go through those and replace lower quality with higher quality items. I am ok with stains and patched holes on their play clothes, but dressier clothes have to be pretty stain and hole free to stay in their wardrobes.

## Pay attention to washing day

I know I don’t have enough clothing for any area if I’m washing daily and they are out of something. And likewise, if I’m up with the daily washing and there is excess available clothing, I know I can par down more.

You can find also more general tips [here](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/thin-closet/) too from Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist website that you may find helpful. Also Courtney Carver’s book [Project 333](https://amzn.to/2ZdURKp) on developing minimalist wardrobes may be helpful too.

_And if your wardrobe needs a total rehaul and you have a hard time knowing where to start, you may enjoy my Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide. Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” If you’d like that guide, feel free to email me at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _and I can send that off to you._

Cheers,

Kelly
