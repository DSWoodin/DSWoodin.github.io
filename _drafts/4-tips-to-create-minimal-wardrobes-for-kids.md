Minimal living and wardrobes for kids? How does that even work? We have four kids so, I mean, that’s a lot of kids' clothing too, so it’s going to be a lot of clothes even with minimal wardrobes. But we’ve learned steps that have certainly helped. On the blog today I’m sharing four steps to create minimal wardrobes for kids.

#### 1. Pick your number

Pick a number for each category of clothing that works for you and your kids. Keep in mind how often you do laundry and how often they soil their clothing. For our kids, for most areas, they have 3-4 items (tees, long sleeves, shorts, etc). I also have one to two items for their “dressier clothes” aka button down shirts and jeans or a dress for our toddler.

#### 2. Choose quality

Choosing better quality clothing will help their wardrobes last longer, essentially. I like to focus on quality and colour. Dark colours preferred over lights and good quality over lower quality that will easily pill, rip, or stain. I prefer either high quality natural or athletic wear fabrics as both hold up very well for our kids.

#### 3. Decluttering and maintaining the wardrobe

Remove items that no longer fit, work, or are unfixable now and as they pop up. I’m often given hand me downs, so will go through those and replace lower quality with higher quality items. I am ok with stains and patched holes on their play clothes, but dressier clothes have to be pretty stain and hole free to stay in their wardrobes.

#### 4. Pay attention to washing day

I know I don’t have enough clothing for any area if I’m washing daily and they are out of something. And likewise, if I’m up with the daily washing and there is excess available clothing, I know I can par down more.

You can find also more general tips [here](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/thin-closet/) too from Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist website that you may find helpful. Also Courtney Carver’s book [Project 333](https://amzn.to/2ZdURKp) on developing minimalist wardrobes may be helpful too.

### A LOOK AT MY KIDS' CURRENT SUMMER MINIMAL WARDROBES

* Our ten year old has the most amount of clothing due to him having to hand me down his clothes to his brothers! He has 5 t-shirts, 4 pairs of shorts, two dress short sleeves, and one pair of dress shorts. All of the boys have one pair of sneakers, one pair of sandals, and one pair of boots. I linked the sandals we buy and boots in my Amazon shops as they tend to last through more than one kid quite easily: [Amazon US Shop link](www.amazon.com/shop/simplehomemom) and [Amazon Canadian Shop link](www.amazon.ca/shop/simplehomemom).


* My younger two boys have 4 t-shirts, 2-3 dress t-shirts, and 2 dress shorts. 


* My toddler daughter has 3 t-shirts, 3 pairs of shorts, 2 dresses, and 2 dressy dresses.

We tend to keep play clothes through all boys as long as they are not falling apart or full of stains that won't come out. We replace things as we go along and are also thankful for family members during Christmas and birthdays who love gifting clothes too.
