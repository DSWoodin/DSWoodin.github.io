##So, funny story...

I watched a great video where Damian Brady @damovisa dived in to DevOps [link] where I noticed the cool stickers he had designed. 

I asked Damian if i could print some so he kindly shared the template to me on Sticker Mule... I ordered some stickers from sticker mule

After a little time the stickers arrived in Australia from the US and I added it with pride of place on my Surface
