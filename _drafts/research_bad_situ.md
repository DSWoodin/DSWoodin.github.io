 My sister gave me some good advice about being in a bad situation - do research, look around, try to line up other options. Even if it doesn't come to anything if you take control of your situation to some degree by coming up with an escape plan it will make your present situation a lot more tolerable. I know it's really helped me in the past. Good luck!
