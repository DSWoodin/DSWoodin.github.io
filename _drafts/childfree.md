 No shame required. I always flip flop whether I'd eventually like a child or not. But truthfully this world is meant to be experienced. By the time a child turns 18 on average you could go experience something like 300K(?) worth of this world. Your purpose does not have to be reproduction. There are so many ways to make this world better for the next generation than breeding that generation. I hope the guilt subsides. Kids don't have to be your personal property for you to enrich their lives.
