Business analysis is not the type of career where you need to necessarily be prepared for anything, but expect the occasional surprise or unexpected situation. In most business analyst jobs, you’ll experience a fair amount of variety in your day-to-day work. And while this is not a role like IT support requiring near-constant interaction with others and real-time prioritization, priorities shift and a certain amount of flexibility and responsiveness is important. Of course, if your company experiences a catastrophe or uncovers a significant unexpected opportunity you will most likely be called in to help on short notice, but that’s the exception, not the rule.

Most often your days will not hit you, instead, you’ll hit them. The best business analysts drive the
requirements process. This means scheduling meetings, managing input, influencing stakeholders, and
ensuring decisions are made. Great business analysts are proactive and seek out answers. If this is not a comfortable role for you, it might be possible to find positions where you can partner with a strong project manager. In general, however, you should be prepared for planning out your own work to meet deadlines (possibly set by yourself, possibly imposed) and facilitating input and occasionally follow-ups from a variety of people to achieve your end goals.
