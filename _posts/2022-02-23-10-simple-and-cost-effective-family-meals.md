I love getting meal inspiration from other families just like ours, so thought I'd write down all of our simple and cost effective family meals here for you. Hopefully you find something new to try. Tag me on instagram [@simplehomemom](www.instagram.com/simplehomemom) if you do! I bring you: 10 simple and cost effetive family meals.

#### Why simple and cost effective family meals?

Because life is busy and most of the time kids do better with simple rather than elaborate meals..and plus it means less prep time for us. It's the ideal situation, right? I'm a fan of quick, simple, healthy meals that get repeated often. I'll be sharing our most popular meals in my blog for you today. They are in no particular order. I'd also love to hear what your favourites are; feel free to leave a comment!

#### 1. NACHOS

![A plate of nachos.](/uploads/nachos-shm.jpg "10 Simple and Cost Effective Family Meals Nachos SHM")

This is one of our "fun" meals that we have periodically, but it's always a hit and can have so many variations to it.

**Ingredients:**

* Nachos
* Shredded cheese
* Any variation of meat such as: ham bits, bacon, chicken, hamburger
* Any variation of veggies such as: peppers, onions, hot peppers, green onions, tomato

Serve the nachos on their own after broiling in the oven or with sour cream and/or salsa. If we're feeling like splurging a little, we buy Doritos and use those for the nachos. It's sooooo tasty!

<br>

#### 2. PICKY PLATES

Picky plates or finger foods are what we do for most of our lunches. I put them in a round container with separated sections. I use my picky plate planner page from [my Simple Meal Planning Guide](https://www.simplehomemom.com/the-simple-meal-planning-guide/) to plan it out. I make sure to have a variety of foods from different food groups such as:

* nuts
* dairy
* protein
* fruits and vegetables

You can find out more about picky plates in [my Meal Planning Guide](https://www.simplehomemom.com/the-simple-meal-planning-guide/) that includes printables and steps to make your own picky plates as well as on this blog [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-make-lunches-painless-and-quick-with-picky-plates/) about picky plates.

I make instant pot quinoa/rice. Find a good recipe [here](https://minimalistbaker.com/instant-pot-quinoa-fluffy-perfect-no-soaking/). I add spices like cumin and oregano. I'll use broth instead of water if I have some too.

Veggies is usually roast veggies or steamed veggies. Whatever we feel like or have to use up. Olive oil, salt, and pepper is our go to mix.

<br>
