    <p>Hi Furries!<br>
        To vend in the state of Wisconsin, you are required to have a valid Wisconsin Tax ID. If you do not have one
        already, you can get one here (<a
            href="https://tap.revenue.wi.gov/mta/_/#0">https://tap.revenue.wi.gov/mta/_/#0</a>), and click Register A
        Business to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the “Sign Up” button below to apply to be a vendor in Fur Squared’s Dealer’s Den. You will need
        your personal information as well as links to your website/social media in order to show us your wares.

    <h2>Additional Info</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that the Dealer’s Den Table (or tables) is/are purchased <b>SEPARATELY</b> from convention
        attendance. <b><u>The cost of a Dealer’s Den table at Fur Squared 2022 is $75</u></b>. We have
        <b><em>extremely</em></b>
        limited 2-table spots, primarily our
        two “corner” spots (see the DD Map included in the Dealer’s Den application link below). Other two-table booths
        will be considered but single-table booths will be prioritized so that we can get as many vendors as possible in
        our limited Dealer’s Den space. Please note in the application if you can work within a consolidated space.
    </p>
