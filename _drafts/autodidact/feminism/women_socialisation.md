 So, a couple of things.

1. I get feeling like you *have* to do this stuff. I do. Socialization is strong. Tradition is strong. Expectations are strong. Overcoming that stuff is real work.
2. It can be helpful to realize that all of this stuff is a choice. No one will die if you don't do it. They might be disappointed, they might be mad, they might think you're a Grinch, but that's it. They'll have some negative emotions.
3. Managing other people's negative emotions isn't your job. That means you **don't** have to bake cakes or buy presents or anything else to prevent your husband from being grumpy. You really don't. His emotions are his to manage. The proof is that even doing all of that stuff, he still had negative emotions.
4. It might be helpful to sit and think for a while about what actually brings you joy, what traditions are meaningful, and what your needs are. Then communicate those things with integrity to your partner. By communicating with integrity, I mean speak from a place of wanting to be understood, not wanting to control or manipulate.

EDIT: I hope this conversation has been meaningful to some of you and helped you be more mindful about what you're spending your valuable time and energy on, especially during this very busy time of year. A couple of threads I want to tease out.

1. There's lots of "screw tradition" type stuff being said. If that's what feels best for you, great! But many people have meaningful traditions that they wish to continue, even if it takes effort. That's fine! You don't have to abandon traditions just because they take effort, just make sure that the tradition still serves you and you're not serving the tradition.
2. I think that we should always look for ways to serve our partners (meaningful service is one of the purest expressions of love IMO). One meaningful way we can serve is to participate in our partner's traditions, even if those traditions don't speak to us. 
3. Many have mentioned that it sounds like the OP's partner doesn't appreciate the work she does. That may or may not be true. But the truth is (in this case and literally every other one) that the OP can only control what she does. She can't make her partner behave differently, she can only make choices about own behavior. Unless she wants to leave her partner (which is not indicated) the best way forward is communicating with integrity.
4. Some have suggested not performing this work so those around OP will learn to appreciate her. I, personally, disagree with this course of action. This is little different than making choices to avoid others' negative emotions. Every time we act in an attempt to control other peoples' emotions, we damage our relationships because we're not acting or choosing with integrity. Do the thing or not, based on **your** wants and needs.
