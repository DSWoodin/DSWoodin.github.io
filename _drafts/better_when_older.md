 Absolutely better.

* I'm more established in my career, 

* feel more comfortable simply making statements ("That's rude." "That's gatekeeping." "You are interrupting." "This policy proposal has flaws." "I own my part in how that went down.") without having to couch those statements language that would make one ignore the intended outcome, 

* I'm taken more seriously by others because I magically have reached the age where it is considered acceptable that I might have a point to my statements, 

* I know my body and it rarely surprises me, 

* puberty has fully and completely stopped and I'm settled in to who I really am and quite like her so I don't mind rejection as much as that simply means I get to spend more time with likable me, 

* I'm at an age where everyone has a therapist so mental health is now openly discussed in a supportive fashion which has led to positive mental health outcomes for myself, 

* after experimenting in my 20s I have settled in to a career I enjoy not just tolerate, 

* I have decades of history with my oldest friends to rely on so can count on their unwavering support whenever I need to be validated or borrow their confidence in me especially when I made a mistake I'm self-flagellating for, 

* a certain class of predators have left me alone as I've aged out of their target demographic and that's noticeably stress relieving, 

* because my preference have existed so long I'm now no longer "weird" but "quirky" for them (wear flats and not heels, really like the color pink, am very function-over-form in terms of possessions) 

... Stuff like that.

I highly recommend advancing in age from 20s to 30s. I'm excited to see what new amazing each further decade will bring.
