We present MicroBVS, an R package for Dirichlet-tree multinomial models with Bayesian variable selection, 
for the identification of covariates associated with microbial taxa abundance data. The underlying Bayesian 
model accommodates phylogenetic structure in the abundance data and various parameterizations of covariatesâ€™ 
prior probabilities of inclusion. While developed to study the human microbiome, our software can be
employed in various research applications, where the aim is to generate insights into the relations between 
a set of covariates and compositional data with or without a known tree-like structure.
