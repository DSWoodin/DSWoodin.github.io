Neural Machine translation directly calculates
... a given wire happens to be carrying "$$\lvert 0\rangle$$."
By that we mean that it's carrying the linear combination


$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

$$
P(y | x)=P\left(y_{1} | x\right) P\left(y_{2} | y_{1}, x\right) P\left(y_{3} | y_{1}, y_{2}, x\right) \ldots P\left(y_{T} | y_{1}, \ldots, y_{T-1}, x\right)
$$
