Windows 7 features<br/>To upgrade XP to Windows 7 logistically data will need to be backed up, HDD wiped, reimage with Windows 7 and restore data. Technical reasons such as file system changes are responsible for the logistic hardship.<br/>However; the benefits of Windows 7 include faster than XP-Vista performance especially where the user will notice it the most i.e. wake up speed.<br/>Windows 7 UI is dramatically different from XP or Vista and this document should hopefully explain a few of the difference. <br/><br/>Anatomy of the Taskbar<br/><br/>The Windows 7 Taskbar still resembles the older Windows XP Versions Tool bar but is essential more task-centric, with some great usable features added on.<br/><br/>Old Windows XP Task Bar<br/> <br/><br/>New Windows 7 Task Bar<br/> <br/>Icons<br/>When you open an application, an icon appears along your task bar, the same as XP.  However, one of the changes Microsoft has made in Windows 7 is that it is now combining multiple files for the same program under one icon.<br/><br/>Aero Peek<br/>This is a new feature which allows you to quickly locate items on your desktop, or open windows.  To view the desktop, slide the mouse to the right end of the task bar where there is a shaded rectangle.  The windows you currently have open will become transparent, and you will be able to see directly through to your desktop.<br/><br/>To quickly find a window, hover over the individual icons along your task bar, small windows will pop up showing you a snapshot of that window.  You can click on that window to bring it to the forefront.  You can also click on the X in the top right corner, and close out of that window completely.<br/> <br/><br/>Right-Click Options on Icons<br/>Windows 7 Also gives you a whole new host of options when you right click on an icon.<br/><br/>For example: If you hover over the Internet Explorer Icon, and right click, you will see the following Menu:<br/><br/>(Insert Pic Here.)<br/><br/>Quickly Clear Your Desktop Using Aero Shake<br/> <br/>Aero Shake is a great new feature that immediately minimizes all of the windows on your desktop except for the one you choose.  To accomplish this, click and hold on the top of any window with your mouse, and give the window a little shake.  All the other windows will instantly minimize.  To get them back, simply shake that same window again.<br/><br/>Sizing Windows using Aero Snap<br/> <br/>Aero Snap is a new feature that allows you to snap windows into a dual paned or maximized view. <br/> <br/>To engage snap, simply click and hold your window and drag it to the top or sides of your screen.<br/><br/>    * The top edge will maximize the window.<br/>    * The left OR right edge will make the window take up half the screen.<br/><br/><br/>Aero Flip 3 D    keys: [windows button] + [tab]<br/>By holding down the windows start button next to the alt button, and striking the tab key, you will create a cascading windows affect which will allow you to flip through all currently open windows on your desktop.<br/><br/>Alt + Tab     keys: [alt] + [tab]<br/>By holding down the alt button (on either side of the space bar) and clicking the tab key, you can switch between all open files on  your desktop.  You will see a bar with small icons for each application, each containing the file name or page title when you switch to it.<br/><br/>Using the Task Bar to Organize Your Screen<br/> <br/>Windows has made some changes to how your toolbar can automatically organize your screen for you.  By right clicking on any empty space on your toolbar, you now have the option to:<br/> <br/><br/>    * Cascade Windows<br/>    * Show Windows Stacked<br/>    * Show Windows Side by Side<br/>    * Show Your Desktop<br/><br/>Libraries<br/><br/>Windows XP and Vista used something called Known Folders as a standard set of places for you to store your files. In XP, the primary folder was My Documents.<br/><br/>Windows 7 contains a set of libraries that can take the place of the standard folders found in XP and Vista.  A library is displayed in a similar manner to XP's known folders however, it simply references its true directory.  Imagine you have the ability to create your own M drive structure.  Referencing only your most used folders in any particular hierarchy. (Only network locations that have been indexed, or a folder that has been made available offline can be added to the Windows library)<br/><br/><br/>New Ribbon interface on Wordpad and Paint<br/>Windows Live applications?<br/>Internet Explorer 8.0, Smart screen/In private filters and InPrivate Browsing, Web Slices, Accelerators.<br/>UAC slider<br/>Action centre, UAC control, backup centre<br/>Windows firewall, Public and Private<br/>Bitlocker, Bitlocker to go lock down USB storage devices, which can prevent the copying of unauthorised data or data loss should the drive be compromised.<br/>Applocker, replaces software restriction policies as a means of identifying and controlling which applications can be installed on a system. From a variety of methods, such as file name, path location and or hash calculation.  Applocker give IT more granular control over application installations and which scripts can be run.<br/>The credential manager<br/>Problem steps recorder, produces html report<br/>A new troubleshooting link from within control panel.<br/>Media player 12<br/>Windows power shellv2.0<br/>BrancheCache with Enterprise 2008 R2, much faster access time, reduces bandwidth.<br/>DirectAccess with Enterprise 2008 R2<br/>Windows XP mode<br/>Software Assurance, benefits to the user?<br/>Application compatability, detail what has been tested?<br/>Software Assurance can make use of training vouchers.
