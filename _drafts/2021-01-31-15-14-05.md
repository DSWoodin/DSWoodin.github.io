When people hear two things in conjunction with one another, they form a little unconscious link between them. 

So, you don't have to believe something as fucking absurd as Jewish Space Lasers causing California wild fires. But the brain does internalize a link between something bad - the wild fires - with something else - Jews. It's conditioning. It doesn't happen through one absurdity. But it is a constellation of similar sentiments, "jokes", conspiracy theories, and other subtle methods of deumanization.

The absurdity of the claim works in their favor. Because you remember the absurdity. Things that are absurd and comical are memorable. And the falseness of the claim doesn't necessarily detract from the subconscious linkage of the object with the negative emotion.
