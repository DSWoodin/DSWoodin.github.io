I was raised in Lexington, Massachusetts and developed a strong affinity for strategy games and analytic problems. In grade school, I spent a lot of time in competitive math which formulated a very structured and rigorous thinking process. During high school, I spent most of my time in competitive debate which helped my logical reasoning and research skills. 

When I first entered Northwestern University, I thought I'd study economics and political science, but after taking a couple computer science courses, I realized the power of computation. My curiosity led me down a journey to better understand computers and AI, so that I could harness them to make people more efficient at what they do.
