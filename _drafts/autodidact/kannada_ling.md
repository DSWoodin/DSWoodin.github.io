 ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ - This week's language of the week: Kannada 
 
 Kannada ( ಕನ್ನಡ [ˈkʌnːəɖɑː] ) is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Kannada people in the South Indian state of Karnataka. With about 50 million speakers across the globe [L1 users: 37,739,040. L2 users: 9,000,000]. Kannada ranks 32 in the list of most spoken languages in the world. It is one of the scheduled languages of India and the official and administrative language of the state of Karnataka.
 History:
 
 Pre-old Kannada (Purava Halegannada) has a history of over 2000 years where the Ashoka rock edict found at Brahmagiri (dated to 230 BC) has been suggested to contain words in identifiable Kannada. 'Chariton mime', a Greek theatre play from the 1st century AD, refers to Kannada being a language that was spoken in the Udupi-Malabar section of India.
 
 Perhaps the [Halmidi inscription] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halmidi_inscription
 
 ) (c.450-500AD) is oldest known Kannada language inscription in the Kannada script. Its history can be divided into three periods; Old Kannada (halegannada) from 450–1200 A.D., Middle Kannada (Nadugannada) from 1200–1700 A.D., and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present.
 Linguistics:
 
 Language classification and influences:
 
 The language is classified as follows: Proto-Dravidian -> Proto-South-Dravidian -> Proto-Tamil-Kannada -> Proto–Kannada -> Kannada. Although it is majorly influenced by Proto-Dravidian vocabulary and syntax, modern Kannada vocabulary is greatly influenced by Sanskrit. Instances of Prakrit and Pali can also be found in Kannada language.
 
 Script:
 
 The Proto-Kannada script has its root in ancient Brahmi and appeared around the 3rd century BC. The Pre-Old-Kannada script appeared around the 4th century AD. Old-Kannada script can be traced to around the 10th century AD, whereas Modern-Kannada script appeared around the 17th century AD.
 
 The language follows the Devanagari system of arranging vowels and consonants. It uses forty-nine phonemic letters, divided into three groups: swaragalu (vowels – thirteen letters); vyanjanagalu (consonants – thirty-four letters); and yogavaahakagalu (neither vowel nor consonant – two letters: anusvara ಂ and visarga ಃ).
 
 Kannada has unique features of having two types of "L" sounds (common to other Dravidian languages): 1) l̪ə (ಲ) denti-alveolar lateral approximant 2) ɭə (ಳ) retroflex lateral approximant and two types of "N" sounds: 1) alveolar nasal n (ನ) 2) retroflex nasal ɳ (ಣ)

 Grammar:
 
 Kannada is an agglutinative language like other Dravidian languages are. It follows a subject–object–verb (SOV) order which isn't strictly followed. There are three persons (First, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural) and four different gender systems having "male:non-male" in the singular and "person:non-person" in the plural.
 
 It has seven noun cases and its standard case suffixes for declensions are as follows:
 Case	Name of the case in Kannada	Standard Case-Suffix	Pronunciation of the suffix
 nominative	ಕರ್ತವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಉ	u
 accusative	ಕರ್ಮವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಅನ್ನು/ಅನ್ನ	annu/anna
 instrumental-ablative	ಕರಣವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಇಂದ/ಒಂದಿಗೆ/ಒಡನೆ	inda/ondige/oDane
 dative	ಸಂಪ್ರದಾನವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಇಗೆ	ige
 genitive	ಸಂಭಂದವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಅ	a
 locative	ಅಧಿಕರಣವಿಭಕ್ತಿ	ಅಲ್ಲಿ	alli
 vocative	ಸಂಬೋಧನಾವಿಭಏಕ್ತಿ	ಏ	ē
 
 Verbs have both finite and non-finite forms. What might be interesting is that there is a present-future adjectival participle (Eg.ಮಾಡುವ -“who/which/that does, who/which/that makes”), as well as a past adjectival participle (Eg.ಮಾಡಿದ “who/which/that did, who/which/that made”).
 
 Kannada follows a decimal number system and here are the numerals from 0 to 9:
 Kannada numeral	Kannada transcription
 ೦	sonne (ಸೊನ್ನೆ)
 ೧	ondu (ಒಂದು)
 ೨	eraḍu (ಎರಡು)
 ೩	mūru (ಮೂರು)
 ೪	nālku (ನಾಲ್ಕು)
 ೫	aidu (ಐದು)
 ೬	āru (ಆರು)
 ೭	ēḷu (ಏಳು)
 ೮	enṭu (ಎಂಟು)
 ೯	oṃbattu (ಒಂಬತ್ತು)
