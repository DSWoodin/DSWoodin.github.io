You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

![sky-1426128_1280.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sky-1426128_1280.jpg)


And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```json
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

### Error

**Error:** This is an error box.
