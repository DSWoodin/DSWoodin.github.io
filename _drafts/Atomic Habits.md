A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically.

four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—

“the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.

We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.
Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

Positive Compounding
Productivity compounds.

Knowledge compounds.

Relationships compound.

Negative Compounding
Stress compounds.

Negative thoughts compound.

Outrage compounds.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment.

It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.

Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored.

Change can take years—before it happens all at once.

my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment.

Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.

goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.

Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.

This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.

It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.

The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

It is a simple two-step process:
1.Decide the type of person you want to be.
2.Prove it to yourself with small wins.

feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.

“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.

Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly.

They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit.

What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.

Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.

Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior.

Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.

The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.

How to Create a Good Habit
The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

How to Break a Bad Habit
Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.

As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.

categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.

implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

The habit stacking formula is:
“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.

Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).

many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.

redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:

The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.

Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.

habits can be easier to change in a new environment.

“One space, one use.”

If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.
A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.

addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.

“disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.

“cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.

A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.

dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.

It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.

Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.

Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”

1.After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2.After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.

We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them.

We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1.The close.
2.The many.
3.The powerful.

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior.

The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.

The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth.

We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status.

A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive.

Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.
• Find love and reproduce = using Tinder
• Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook
• Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram
• Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google
• Achieve status and prestige = playing video games

The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.

A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.

Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.

You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.

Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.

motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.

We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action.

motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress

When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.

you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation,

Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.”

Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.

Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.*

Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.

This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.

On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.

Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life.

reducing the friction within your home or office.

when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort.

The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.

habits you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are thinking.

handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments.

We are limited by where our habits lead us.

Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”

The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved.

The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work.

casting votes for your new identity.

habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal.

A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.

The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.

onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time.

When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.

The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.

more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.

Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.

What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.

delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.

our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.
Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency

With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad.

As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*

What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way.

reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.

important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.

Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence

“Don’t break the chain”

habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.

The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.

The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.

Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you.

it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope.

The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can derail your habits.

Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”

Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you.

But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.

Make it immediately unsatisfying.

If you’re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.

In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence individual behavior.

A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.

The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.

Competence is highly dependent on context.

“Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.”

Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation.

The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality.*

In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you.

explore/exploit trade-off.
In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration.

What feels like fun to me, but work to others?

What makes me lose track of time?

Where do I get greater returns than the average person?

What comes naturally to me?

“Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.

A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.

People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.

Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.

the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.

really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.

“Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”

variable reward.*

This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.

doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors.

Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.

The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”

Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement.

“decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.*

1.What went well this year?
2.What didn’t go so well this year?
3.What did I learn?

1.What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2.How am I living and working with integrity right now?
3.How can I set a higher standard in the future?

the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.

The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.

The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.

Awareness comes before desire.

Happiness is simply the absence of desire.

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase.

Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.

With a big enough why you can overcome any how.

Being curious is better than being smart.

Emotions drive behavior.

We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.

Your response tends to follow your emotions.

Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state.

Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it.

Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.

Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.

Our expectations determine our satisfaction.

Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting

The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.

Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.

Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.
