### Postdoc
#### Requirements
· PhD degree in Computer Science, Informatics, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, Chemistry/Chemical Sciences or Biological Sciences
· Strong programming skills: ((Python | Perl) & (C | C++ | Java) & R)
· Strong quantitative background (machine learning, Bayesian inference, etc.) or computational genomics experiences (DNA sequence analysis, microarray analysis, etc.) or cancer biology/immunology
· Good knowledge of molecular biology and genomics
· Good spoken and written communication skills, mature and motivated.
#### How to apply
Interested applicants should submit a letter of interest with a research proposal in English for a project (~1 page) to be conducted during postdoctoral training, CV, and three references (including name and contact information) to zexianzeng@pku(dot)edu(dot)edu

### Research Technician
#### Overview
We are seeking a highly motivated research technician that will be an important member of our team and will work on multiple ongoing projects in the laboratory. The individual will primarily work with a postdoctoral fellow applying a variety of innovative laboratory techniques including CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screening, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing library preparation, western blotting, in vivo mouse techniques, molecular biology cloning, and bioinformatic analysis. In addition to laboratory experiments, the position will also include some laboratory management and maintenance responsibilities. The candidate will be expected to independently analyze data, write up protocols and procedures, produce figures for manuscripts, give presentations at lab meeting, and attend departmental seminars and meetings. The ideal candidate would have at least two years of availability to dedicate to this role.
#### Responsibilities
· Tissue culture of human cancer cell lines
· Protein, DNA, and RNA isolation
· Western Blotting
· Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
· Next-generation sequencing library preparation
· Molecular cloning and design of shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA constructs
· PCR and real-time PCR
· Cell viability, apoptosis, cell proliferation assays
· May be responsible for mouse handling, dosing, and colony maintenance
· Ordering laboratory reagents and maintaining proper stock of all general lab supplies
· Maintaining an up to date laboratory notebook with detailed records of experiments and procedures
· Other research or organizational duties when needed
#### Additional Skills, Knowledge & Abilities
· Bachelor’s Degree in biological sciences
· Previous laboratory research experience in basic cellular and molecular biology research is required
· Excellent communication skills
· Excellent analytical and logical skills
· Ability to learn and grasp new concepts quickly
· Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment

### Associate Computational Biologist 
#### Overview
We are seeking motivated Associate Computational Biologists to work full time on projects involving the organization and analysis of large-scale genomics data. The lab conducts research in the following areas: cancer immunology and immunotherapy, CRISPR screens, and single-cell analysis. Successful candidates will address methodological and computational challenges related to the integrative analyses of a variety of data types.
#### Responsibilities
· Draw upon knowledge of data science and biology to design and develop software, databases and interfaces for analyzing and manipulating biological data.
· Collaborate with laboratory researchers to develop high throughput data processing and analysis capabilities.
· Communicate results to immediate collaborators, as well as bioinformatic and clinical communities.
· Implement and document reliable and efficient software with well designed interfaces. 
· Implement pipelines to automate tasks that reduce and consolidate output from software.
· Monitor and process new data from public databases.
· Maintain the computational infrastructure for large-scale studies. 
· Implement web interfaces and APIs to facilitate end users’ needs.
#### Who Should Apply?
· BSc or MSc graduates in Computer Science, Informatics, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, Chemistry/Chemical Sciences or Biological Sciences with an interest in Biomedical Data Science.
· Students taking gap years (>= 2 years) to accumulate computational biology research experience towards future PhD or MD applications.
· People with programming skills along with an interest in cancer genomics and a willingness to learn.
#### Additional Skills, Knowledge & Abilities
· Applicants must have an undergraduate or master's degree in a quantitative field.
· Applicants must have experience developing software projects using Python and analyzing data using R.
· Applicants with experience in web development or computational pipeline development in both cluster and cloud environments are preferred.
· Prior genomics or bioinformatics research experience is a plus but not required.
