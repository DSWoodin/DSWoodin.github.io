The digital world has been a part of my life for as long as I've been a mom - ten years now. And over the years, I've had to grapple with why I use [social media](www.instagram.com/eastcoastkelly) in particular. For me, it's all about the WHY in why I'm showing up in the digital world. Over the years, I've had to create boundaries with the digital world. It used to suck me in often. So my relationship with the digital world is often under reassessment to make sure the time I spend here is with intention. It'll look different for everyone, of course. For me currently, I come to the digital world for _inspiration, support, and community_. It's not meant to replace my "real life", but to add to it. To be a part of my life, but not to become my life. When I remind myself of these things, it helps me to stick to these things. Without the guilt or time sucking (as often). ⁣For me, having healthy digital boundaries:

* It means I don't reach for my phone as soon as I wake up. I turn to my morning routine instead. ⁣
* It means I don't touch my phone (much) when I'm homeschooling - my attention is with them. Sometimes I do pop in when they're doing independent work, but that's a boundary I made for myself I'm comfortable with. ⁣
* It means I have set aside times to check into social media. This one is newer to me and it's still a work in progress, but it's getting there!⁣

#### Here are a couple practical tips in setting digital boundaries:⁣

1\. Turn off your notifications from popping up automatically. ⁣  
2\. Set limits for checking notifications and other messages. Such as: morning, evening, or just timing yourself and not checking them as they pop up.⁣
