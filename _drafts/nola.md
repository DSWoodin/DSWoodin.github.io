 Bourbon Street, New Orleans. It's really just the same as any other bar district in any other large city around the world. Same old cover bands playing the same old songs that you'd hear anywhere. You can experience all you need just by walking down the street for an hour and not going in anywhere.

Frenchman Street on the other hand is absolutely amazing. Everyone should go to NOLA just for that.

EDIT: I'm not knocking NOLA itself though - that city is amazing and definitely somewhere I'm going to return to next time I return to the USA on holiday!
