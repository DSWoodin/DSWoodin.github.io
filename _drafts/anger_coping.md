 I'm not male but I have the same issue. (If it isn't ok to post I will delete.)

It is tough, for sure.

I want to be seen as strong, independent cheerful and industrious, even when inside I feel the opposite of that sometimes.

My way of 'coping' with negative feelings was to either ignore them or distract myself. I did this so automatically that sometimes, I didn't even notice I was seething anger or full of sadness. This... did not help in any way.

Even worse, I wasn't aware of this pent up rage until it exploded, even though I could have shared this before.

But I couldn't even share it before because I didn't even let myself properly feel and label it as "I feel upset", I didn't have the awareness of my own feelings!

I was too busy pushing it down, so if I didn't even let myself acknowledge it was happening, how could I even tell others about it?

This go-to coping method is only OK if you are in some situation where you cannot find support, e.g. you are stuck at work and your office is toxic. It worked for me in crisis situations but... As a lifelong coping method? Really toxic to our psyche.

That's because it means we never actually label and process our emotions, and move forward, whether that means finding an internal resolution, some practical solution, or asking for help.

First, I want to tell you that anger is good. (Wait, let me explain.)

When you feel anger, you must stop and listen. It is your inner self telling you something you *desperately* need is missing. It is your gut saying, SOMETHING CRUCIAL to your well-being is missing. The stronger it is, the more urgently you must label, stop and listen to what it is trying to tell you.

It is a learning moment and listening to the anger without reacting immediately will teach you important things about yourself.

It is only when we lose ourselves in it that it is 'bad'.

Instead of just glossing over it, now that I have shifted my POV on anger, I now (if I have a moment), can feel anger,  label it as "anger", and just kind of sit with it for a bit.

So I was furious at a work colleague the other day for never telling me when urgent work was urgent. Like REALLY mad. WTH is wrong with her? She is causing delays and messing everything up. What an idiot and inexperienced person, I thought.

I sat fuming for a while... And a few hours later, I went back and looked at this anger. I was still furious. I wondered what need of mine I was not filling by this behavior - of not knowing when work was urgent.

I discovered I truly need structure, consistency and communication. I get upset when things are changed at the last moment. Whereas my coworker valued being loosy goosy more.

Now I know, I have looked at all my other ways to communicate re:work and I am adding systematic, structured communication styles. I don't care if it seems "prissy" or "fussy", because I do good work and this is what I need to be a good consultant.

I reached out to my coworker and told her that requested a bit more structure and details when she hands over assignments, that it is just my style. (Gave her a short checklist.) And she said she liked how organized I was.

So I learned something from that anger. It was productive, constructive anger. And it has improved my other work connections too.

It is OK to be angry (and most other 'bad' emotions) because it teaches you what you need to be happy and fulfilled...

 And if someone loves you, sharing what you need with them actually makes them glad and happy. (See Tara Brach's podcasts for thoughts on this.)

Not sharing these needs, pretending you are invincible, is another way of building a wall, and let me tell you, it will get in the way of deep connections (source: my life plus 10 years of depression).

Don't deprive your family and friends of access to your innermost self. Your needs are not burdens. They are opportunities for people who love you to grow closer to you and enjoy you more. Don't shut them out.

I still lose myself to anger or sadness and other 'bad'/'burdensome' emotions sometimes, for sure. And I often don't reveal them to people I don't trust and it takes a looong while for me to trust... It is my lifelong habit.

So I still go through rollercoasters of emotions, and it sucks. But slowly I am changing.

It is a habit. And I am trying my best to break it.

Hope this is helpful. Good luck!
