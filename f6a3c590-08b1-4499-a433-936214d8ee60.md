 There's been a few posts on there about that - dads often see the fun side of baby rearing and not the shitty parts (pregnancy, screaming, hormonal issues, postnatal depression, career stalling) because it defaults to the woman a lot of the time. Like he wants a kid but is pissed off at a crying baby? Mate that's what babies DO... face reality if that is the future you want but I wont be doing it.
