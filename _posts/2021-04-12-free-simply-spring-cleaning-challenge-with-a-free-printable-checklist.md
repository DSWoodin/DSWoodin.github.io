Hello! It's Spring and bring out all of the Spring Cleaning challenges, right? I don't always do Spring cleaning, but when I do, it's usually done with friends. Because otherwise, I find I don't bother. It's way more fun with friends. Today, I'm sharing a free simply spring cleaning challenge with a free printable checklist. Scroll down to snatch that!

## Why bother doing a bit of spring cleaning?

* It helps us to look forward to the warmer days to come.. If you're in a four seasons area like us.
* It gives us a chance to perhaps focus on areas of the home that have been forgotten about. Just me??
* It can become a part of your yearly home routines.

  According to [Creating Mary's Home blog](https://creatingmaryshome.com/spring-cleaning-challenge/#:\~:text=Cleaning%20is%20a%20safe%20and,the%20rest%20of%20your%20year!):

> ["Cleaning is a safe and healthy way to lift your mood! ... Spring Cleaning is a way of getting your entire home deep-cleaned in one go, so the rest of the year you can simply focus on maintenance cleaning. Deep cleaning makes a big impact on your home and the rest of your year!" ](https://creatingmaryshome.com/spring-cleaning-challenge/#:\~:text=Cleaning%20is%20a%20safe%20and,the%20rest%20of%20your%20year!)

**And if cleaning isn't your thing, that's ok, too. I don't like cleaning much either usually unless I'm in the mood, but also enjoy a unique challenge. So, here I am. And I hope it's helpful for you.**

I usually do a spring cleaning something every year. The last couple have been mostly decluttering, but this year I am joining with my friend Jessica over at[ Mama Bear Wooten](https://mamabearwooten.com/) (or on Instagram [@mama_bear_wooten](https://www.instagram.com/mama_bear_wooten/)) to bring you a unique ten day challenge. There are two daily tasks you can pick from AND bonus tasks when you snag the printable challenge from both of our blogs too: Quick 15 minute tasks or abandoned tasks. I'm doing, you can guess it, abandoned tasks, while Jessica is doing quick 15 minute cleaning tasks.

**In this freebie printable, you'll find ten days of abandoned tasks to complete, plus  bonus quick 15 minute tasks. Grab your freebie simply spring cleaning challenge printable checklist** [**HERE**](https://mailchi.mp/8ec31b16f849/simplyspringcleaningchallenge)**. Happy cleaning!**

And then make sure to pop on over to[ Jessica's blog](https://mamabearwooten.com/simply-spring-cleaning-challenge-with-a-free-printable-checklist/) to read and then print out her challenge that goes hand in hand with mine here - she has ten 15 minute cleaning challenges plus 5 bonus challenges. Print them both out and pick through them!
