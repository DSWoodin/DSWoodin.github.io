# Lines

I finished to work on **Lines**, a web3 app where every user can write
his thoughts and make them available forever.

For make it possible I used the following technologies:
Hardhat, NodeJs, NextJs, ReactJs, TailwindCss, Web3, EthersJs,
Ipfs, Pinata, Infura, Metamask, Polygon, Matic, Vercel, Surge.

The goal of the project is to create a platform where users
can share their thoughts in a decentralized and censorship resistant way.

Follow thÃ© instruction on the website to create your account and start to write.
The project is still in development, but you can try it here: <https://linesapp.vercel.app/>
The Repo is here: <https://github.com/scobru/lines-monorepo>
