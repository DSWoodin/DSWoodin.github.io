AKASH INSTITUTE was established in Bettiah as a premier education institute 
to foster a keen, concept based learning environment for CBSE & state board 
examinations by bringing the best of Bettiahâ€™s teaching methodology, study 
material and experienced faculty. 

Based on modern pedagogy, AKASH INSTITUTE brings qualified and 
experienced faculty with the chief effort to get the best out of every student 
from class NC to XII. We believe that at this age, a student needs additional 
attention, consistent guidance and motivation, along with a concerned 
atmosphere for them to excel and improve their success rate in competitive 
exams. Apart from improving excellence in academics we ensure the 
students at Southern KOTA are provided with all round Personality 
development, which includes Moral Education, Enhance communication & 
presentation skills in English, Yoga & Meditation for physical, mental & 
spiritual fitness. We are capable to groom both average and brilliant students 
and we leave no stone unturned to render the best out of them.

We believe in optimal & balanced IQ-EQ development to equip students to 
ace not just the competitive examinations, but all stages of preparation to 
excel in their academic career. Our mentoring, counselling & motivational 
sessions hone their minds and build strength and endurance to take on the 
competitive examinations. Additionally, we provide regular mentorship from 
experts on test-taking, time management and stress management skills.

This is our institute's prospectus. It includes all the necessary information like Faculties, Fee structure and Facilities.
