<strong>Overview</strong>: I am trying to image a computer and it is not joining the 'Contoso' domain<br/>I restructured a sub OU, what changes need to be made to add the computers to the renamed OU?<br/><br/><strong>Resolution: </strong>Reset the FQN for each renamed OU in the MDT DataBase.  The task sequence references the MDT database during the step.
