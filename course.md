> Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms was an amazing experience! I loved the units; each was something that I needed to dig into more as I work to simplify my life and home. The layout for this course was perfect, giving time and space to work on each subject before moving on. I love that I can go back and work through the ones that are more challenging for my household. Kellyâ€™s support and encouragement to tackle things one small bit at a time was just what I needed! I will definitely recommend this course to my friends who are looking to make changes in their lives to simplify. - Deanna

### About me

Hi, I'm Kelly! Iâ€™m a mother of four children - three boys, one toddler girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. Iâ€™m a past elementary teacher, turned stay at home, work at home mom eight years ago after I had my second child. Iâ€™ve found that the busier Iâ€™ve become and as my children age, that itâ€™s become even more important to figure out what is most important to me and us as a family. Living a simpler lifestyle has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, and stronger connections with my people. It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of my home and life. I enjoy helping busy moms simplify home life by teaching flexible planning methods and skills. Listen more about my take on simplifying things at home on a podcast I was interviewed on [here](https://www.stitcher.com/show/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/episode/keeping-it-simple-an-interview-with-kelly-79787253).
