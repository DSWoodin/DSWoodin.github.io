## High-energy neutrinos from Blazars

## Abstract

High-energy neutrino is a special observational window for the high-energy astrophysics. Blazars have been suggested as the promising sources to generate high-energy cosmic rays and high-energy neutrinos. Specially, for the first time , the high-energy neutrino event, IceCube 170922A, was detected in temporal and spatial coincidence with a multiwavelength flare from the known gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056 at a significance level of ∼3σ, implying a hadronic component inside. I will talk about what can we learn from the multi-messenger observations (electromagnetic radiations and high-energy neutrinos) of Blazars.
