 Buy cheap vegetables, make soup very slowly and thoroughly. Chop everything up into little pieces and just focus intently on every slice. Breathe in the fresh veggie aroma, the smell of browning onions, the smell of broth. Listen to the simmery bubbly sounds and stir gently every now and then. Make yourself a cup of hot tea or a glass of wine while you wait for the flavors to blend and the broth to thicken up. Pretend you are a sweet old grandma. When the soup is ready, get some crackers and pour some in a nice heavy bowl. Pretend you are the beloved little boy or girl eating soup made by your sweet old grandma. Pretend it's like the soup from Zelda, healing you a little with every sip. Slow down and take in the wholesomeness of a homecooked meal prepared with care. Care for yourself and receive that care.
