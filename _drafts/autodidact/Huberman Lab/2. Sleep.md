- falling alseep
- timing your sleep
- sleep quality

reset ability to focuesed alert and emotionally stable when we are awake

other side of the coin is wakefulness

how to get better at sleeping

what factors does quality depend on
- adenosine - builds up longer we are awake - sleep hunger
caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, blocks the adenosine receptor
caffeine increases dopamine - makes us feel good
- sometimes sleep high -> circadian force
block of sleep 6-10h 
sunlight and when you want to sleep

waking -> around sun rise
system generates an internal signal -> hormone -> released from one organ and acts on anothers
cortisol pulse is released from adrenal glands, epinephrine -> adrenal / brain
cortisol with stress usually 
a timer is set when melatonin will be set, 12-14h , from only the pineal gland

pineal gland -> near 4th ventricles
des cartes is the seat of the soul, mono hemispheric
only organ that releases melatonin

melatonin also suppresses the onset of puberty
chronic/tonic release of melatonin hormone in children
could also impact others

melatonin helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep
why we sleep

endogenous -> it would happen instrinsically to human body without external factors, both neural and hormonal
retinal ganglion are brain neurons, outside the skull
a particalur set of these neurons gets triggered by a type of light and send info to the clock called super chiasmatic nucleus (SCN)

SCN has connections to every part of your body

these neurons respond best to the amount and quality of light -> particular contrast of yellows and blues -> best is sunlight
sunlight at **low solar angle**

50 times less effective through window vs actually being outside
late shifted cortisol (8-10)-> anxiety and depression -> correlation

how long to be outside for this? 2-10 mins regularly, not exactly at sunrise
10k-50k lux

light suppresses melatonin, inhibits the pineal

light meter -> to check lux

retianal degenerative disorder -> avoid excessivley bright light

low-visioin / blind people -> as long as they have eyes (no tumor or removed) they also have the ability for the neurons to get activated

neurons called melanopsin ganglion cells set your central clocks dont need to see or perceive the sun

other things can help the cortisol / clock 
- timing of food intake
- exercise
- any drugs

these cells are the only direct way to set the clock

intergeniculate leaflet -> non photic (food, exercise)

sunset also for the end of the day set the clocks to sleep
-> helps protect your brain and body from the negative effects of lights

no extra ocular photoreception in humans

some reptiles have a hole in their skull to get light directly to pineal to suppress melatonin

bad effects of light
the longer you're awake the more sensitive your eyes are to light
ie disrupt sleep pattern

light that arrive to eye from 11pm to 4am -> decreases dopamine release and inhibit learning -> habenula (thalamus) -> disppointment nucleus -> can lead to depression

location of light
- mostly bottom half of retina, ie top visual space
- the cells are designed to detect sunlight
- dim lights set low in the room are best for late night

we tend to be hungrier during wakeful period
lit around nutrition better to restrict to a certain period of time -> circadian code

if you turn on the ligths before waking up, makes you go to sleep earlier every night

if you look at light later in the day, retina is more sensitive, assumes it is sunlight and phase delays the release of melatonin that helps you sleep

people's internal mechanisms are not anchored to anything real

naps can be very beneficial as long as 20/30/1h
groggy -> REM in the daytime

parasym -> calming -> meditation -> relaxation

duration path and outcomes

drugs
- magnesium -> increasing GABA -> help turn DPO, mind drift in space
threonate -> drowsy
- theanine (can make very vivd dreams / sleep walking)
- apigenin (derivative of chamomile, estrogen inhibitor )
