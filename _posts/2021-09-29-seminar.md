## Abstract

So far, more than 250 molecular species have been detected in interstellar space, and different molecules can be used to solve different astrophysics problems. Especially important are complex organic molecules, which can help us understand and answer questions about the origin of life in the universe. This report will introduce the astronomical equipment used to observe these organic molecules, the progress of organic molecular search and observation, and future development trends.
