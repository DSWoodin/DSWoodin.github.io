Hi, my name is **Leonardo Queiroz**, I'm from Brazil but living in Calgary/AB Canada since December 2016. I love jazz, blues and brazilian music and also play keyboard and acoustic guitar. 

I am an enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I have been focusing on data science using statistical and machine learning techniques for prediction and decision making. In February 2022 I completed my Masters in Biomedical Engineering where I applied deep learning models to estimate breathing rate using videos of different spectra.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: ​Work Experience

- Research Associate ([University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/){:target="_blank"}) - May 2019 - Jan 2022: During my research I worked with data collection/pre-processing/analysis, also applied a few Deep Learning models for Object detection/segmentation, Face landmarks detection, Pose estimation and so on. Some of the models I worked with were: Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, RetinaFace, HRNet and OpenPose. I also applied classic machine learning algorithms such as kNN, PCA, SVM and Neural Nets. During this period I also worked as Teaching Assistant with Dr. Jihyun Lee on the Foundations of Mechatronics course, from May 2019 to Dec 2019. My main duties were to guide, assist and evaluate Mechanical Engineering students in laboratory practices with projects involving circuit assembly using Arduino platform programming with sensors and actuators such as DC motor, stepper motor, transistors, diodes, LEDs, LDR, gyroscope and so on.

- Electrical Maintenance Technologist - Instrumentation ([Petrobras](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/){: target = "_blank"}) - Jan 2016 - Dec 2016: This was my last job in Brazil, before moving to Canada. Petrobras is as large oil and gas company where to work at I had to pass a selection test competing with more than 300 people for a single spot, and I took first place. My activities were to perform maintenance on Offshore Automation and Instrumentation systems.

- Before Petrobras I worked in several companies in the areas of industrial, residential and commercial automation, I was also a professor of courses related to my area of training and also worked for several years as telecommunications technician on PTSN - Public Switched Telephone Network.

- Additional informations you can find on my resume. 



## :raised_hands: Volunteering

- 2000 - 2021: In Brazil and Canada (Calgary), I volunteered as a musician in the church, playing keyboard, bass and acoustic guitar on Sundays, following regular schedules of rehearsals and performances.

  

- 2018 - 2018: I was a volunteer at Studio Bell, I worked guiding museum visitors as well as in the entrance of events that take place in the building in front.

  

- 2012 - 2016: In Brazil, I volunteered as a Poll Worker in the elections of 2012,2014, and 2016. My task was to assist people in voting, maintaining the success of the poll station, and helping the country.
