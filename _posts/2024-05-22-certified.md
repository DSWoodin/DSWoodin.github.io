It's been 10 000 years, but I have an update. In my hands is a document that certifies my competency in (very) basic web development, programming, social media campaigns and tech support.

**This is my certificate:**

This blog took a backseat while I focussed on my coursework. I think it really helps to focus on one thing for a time to make real progress.

Takeaways from my year doing a certificate III part time online:

- courses cover topics that you may not learn when self-studying, e.g. copyright, communication
- having deadlines and marks to be accountable for with oversight from an organisation is a great motivator to push through difficult parts
- I still had to 'self-teach' myself by reading course notes, troubleshooting with Google, seeking help from friends
- it gave me a taste of different jobs in IT and helped me to decide what to specialise in

Since completion, I've had a genuine hunger to continue learning. [Kevin Powell's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) on CSS are fun to watch and learn from and I've almost finished [freecodecamp's free responsive web design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) to continue learning HTML and CSS using project learning. I've also started learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org) by watching videos from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys) to build by programming skills.

Once I feel confident in my front-end skills, I plan to move onto back-end coding.
