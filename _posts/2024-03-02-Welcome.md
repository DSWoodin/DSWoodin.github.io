Welcome to my personal website! <br><br>
I've been thinking about creating a modest blog where I can introduce myself, share my thoughts and knowledge, and showcase my work for quite some time now. I am currently planning to use this blog in parallel with [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@musakokcen), since I can reach more people over there. However, I will also create content exclusively for this blog. Currently, you can find a short introduction about me and my portfolio of apps that I have worked on. I hope you will visit again soon and find some valuable content. <br><br>
Best regards,<br>
Musa
