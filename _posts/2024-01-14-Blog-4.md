# Jan 14, 5:33 PM - Blog #4

Hello and welcome to my fourth blog! Thank you for your time. I hope to outline this new site as well as some updates since my last blog post.

In the last post I was on Day 75 of the #Replit100DaysofCode and I am happy to say I finished all 100 lessons! 

It has been a really awesome experience and I really appreciate the Replit team for creating such a fantastic free resource. I learned so much about web design and programming. 

I am proud to say the of over 225k people that have started on day 1, I was the 934th person to complete all 100 days! I had a goal to be one of the first 1000 and I am super glad I was able to sneak in. 

To wrap up the 100 days of code I thought it would be a good idea to combine alot of the skills I had learned to create this website. I have built out a fully functional webpage that is coded in github and public on the web. I also plan to continue to build this site as I learn more and build more projects.
