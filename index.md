So far on the website I have three simple pages:

    - Resources I use for statistics support
    
[Some Link]({% post_url 2018-04-25-first-post %})

- [Ecological statistics]("")
    - Resources I use for my PhD

- [Invasive species research]("")
    - My phd research
    - Draft manuscripts

## Coming soon

- [Coding Sessions]("")

- [Bio-informatics]("")

# Recent news

Here is the [webpage]("https://github.com/davan690/davan690.github.io/") repository for more computer minded (open-source resources and my research), and a [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/")/[twitter]("") feed for new blog posts about statistics and ecology (not all from me).
