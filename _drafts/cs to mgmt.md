If you are a senior who has done a lot of mentoring and have a keen interest in helping people grow, then it could be lateral move with a bit of a learning curve.

But if you are a senior who, for the most part have only managed yourself, it's a step change because you are now responsible for managing people's careers and livelihood. You need to get really good at having uncomfortable conversations, providing guidance and feedback, and learning to resolve conflict between your direct reports.

A lot depends on how much manager training you get and how much management mentorship you can have from your leadership. Even with all that training, it's a big change.

May I recommend officially mentoring more people and working as a tech lead before transitioning to management?

I was an IC who became a manager, went back to being an IC, and became a manager again. Becoming a manager is easy, becoming a good manager is hard. I have come to accept that they really are two different functions that require very different skillsets
