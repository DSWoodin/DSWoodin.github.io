## Vaccination

**To attend FurSquared 2022, one of the following two situations MUST be true:**

### Option 1 - Vaccinated & Boosted

You have completed the primary vaccine series and have received a booster per CDC guidelines linked here: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). The CDC considers boosters to be effective immediately, so there is no additional date restriction.

We require booster shots if your last vaccine series was on or before the following dates:

| Pfizer or Moderna (mRNA) | Johnson & Johnson / Janssen |
| :---: | :---: |
| Last vaccine dose by | Vaccine received by |
| November 14th, 2021 | February 14th, 2022 |

Additionally, if you are **moderately or severely immunocompromised** and over the **age of 11** the CDC recommends a **4th shot (mRNA) or 3rd shot Johnson & Johnson/Janssen** [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). FurSquared does **not** require this additional shot, but strongly suggests that eligible attendees do.

<br />

### Option 2 - Recently Vaccinated

You have completed an initial vaccine series by the time frame listed below. This section only applies if you have received your last vaccine dose too recently (after the above dates) to be eligible for the booster before Fur Squared.

| Pfizer or Moderna (mRNA) | Johnson & Johnson / Janssen |
| :---: | :---: |
| Last vaccine dose by | Vaccine received by |
| March 31st, 2022 | March 31st, 2022 |

Proof of vaccination will be required at registration to purchase or pick up a badge.

## Proof of Vaccination

**For United States residents**, we will accept:

* Physical CDC card
* Photo of CDC card
* Photocopy of CDC card
* Digital vaccine record approved by your home state which displays the following information:
  * Your Legal Name
  * Vaccine Brand
  * Vaccination Dates

Please note that we will **not** accept QR codes as proof of vaccination. You must be able to display the information listed above in plain text on your device.

**For international attendees**, please bring the document your country uses to record proof of vaccination, or a picture or copy of that document.

Any COVID-19 vaccine governmentally approved for use in your home country will be accepted.

## Masking

Masks are required at all times in convention spaces, including while in a fursuit.

Balaclavas, items made of thin & stretchy materials, and single-layer cloth masks alone are not acceptable masks, they must be combined with another type of face covering.

## Policy Changes

In the interest of transparency, we want to advise our attendees that this policy may change in the future. Reasons for a change, if any, will be based on several factors, which may include:

* CDC recommendations
* State & County requirements
* Venue policy
* Ability of volunteer staff to enforce policy

Look to our website for the latest up-to-date information.

## FAQ

### Are the COVID precautions in Milwaukee the same as in my state?

Every state has differences both in law and in custom. If you are concerned about specific risks, we encourage you to check with a doctor and/or research the differences to determine if you feel comfortable attending.

### Where can I see COVID-19 statistics for Brookfield WI (Waukesha County)?

Please see the [COVID-19 Wisconsin Summary Data](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm) dashboard. Waukesha County is directly west of Milwaukee, which is in the south-east portion of the state.

### Will there be unvaccinated people outside of con space?

Yes. Please remember the rest of the hotel, elevators, hallways, restaurant, and other activities are open to the public and we can’t control who will be present. Masks are the most effective protection.

### Will there be unmasked people outside of con space?

Yes. The Sheraton Milwaukee Brookfield has ended their masking policy. The FurSquared mask policy will apply within convention space.

We encourage all attendees to wear masks outside of the convention area.

### I believe someone is creating fraudulent vaccine cards for themselves or others. What can I do?

Creating fraudulent CDC vaccination cards is a federal crime.

To report suspicious activity involving fake vaccination record cards, please contact the appropriate government agency in your state or jurisdiction, HHS-OIG (1-800-HHS-TIPS or [www.oig.hhs.gov](https://www.oig.hhs.gov/)), or the Internet Crime Complaint Center ([www.ic3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/)).

### What happens if someone presents a fraudulent proof of vaccination at the convention?

They will be ejected from the convention, and we will contact law enforcement.
