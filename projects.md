I have always worked in full-time positions so far and developed numerous successful apps. I was fortunate enough to work at studios that develop apps solely for the App Store. This experience enhanced my understanding of user experience, customer satisfaction, and the creation of high-quality apps aligned with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. I have worked on various projects and under different scales of companies with different priorities. With the knowledge gained from these professional experiences, I have also undertaken freelance projects. Here are some of the primary projects I have contributed to in recent years;

results. Initially, my focus was on rectifying existing bugs within the project. Following that, I embarked on
developing personalized UI elements, including a drag-and-drop gallery with a distinctive design and captivating
animations. Furthermore, I ensured its seamless integration with the database, while also developing efficient
download and upload functionalities. https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/lvstudio/id1497816078?platform=ipad

My experiences have elevated me to the level of a professional developer. I have acquired extensive hands-on
expertise across all facets of app development. My responsibilities included leading research and development
initiatives to leverage new technologies and tools, effectively communicating with product managers and designers,
and planning and executing development processes.
In terms of coding, I have demonstrated proficiency in implementing different architectures and design patterns,
consistently applying SOLID principles. I have also prioritized comprehensive unit testing and crafted polished
user interfaces using UIKit, Storyboards, and Xibs. Additionally, I have taken ownership of researching and
integrating third-party tools, such as Crashlytics, analytics platforms, and push notification systems, into projects.
Version control has always been my ally, enabling smooth collaboration with other team members within our agile
environment. As a professional developer, I bring a dedication to excellence to every project I undertake.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
