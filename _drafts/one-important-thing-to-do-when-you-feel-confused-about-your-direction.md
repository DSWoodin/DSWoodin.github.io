**_Where are you heading?_**

Heading slowly in the right direction is 1000% better than heading quickly in the wrong direction (for you). It's so easy to be swept up in the world's speed. My speed, with my crew  of four kids under ten in this season of life is _slowwww_. Sometimes painfully slow for my default ["to do list" personality](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/2020-08-29-10-ways-to-simplify-your-to-do-list/). But I've learned to come back to slow every time, giving space for rest and reassessment. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about one important thing to do when you feel confused about your direction.

Questions to ask yourself if you feel confused about your direction:

* Do I want to keep moving in this direction with my life?
* Is it aligned with my values?
* Am I doing this because I think others think I should?
* Am I doing this because I think I'm supposed to, but don't really want to?

And if you're still not sure, the best thing, the one important thing I've found to do when I feel confused about my direct is to just: PAUSE.  
  
Research on pausing...

And last month was the launch of a special project to me that I worked on slowly, over many months. Simplify your life at home: a course for busy moms launches today. I truly took my time. Pausing and making sure it was the right direction...Every step of the way said "yes"! So I'm celebrating today in the slow and steady and am looking forward to learning alongside these lovely ladies for the next six weeks (round two coming early next year ü§ó).
