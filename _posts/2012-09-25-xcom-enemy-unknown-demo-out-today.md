[![Première partie of APtoBS at KAO](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7271/7079045617_5d69c2df99.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenjohs/7079045617/ "Première partie of APtoBS at KAO by mortenjohs, on Flickr")I just played through the [demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/) of Firaxis' [re-imagination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Unknown)of one of my all time favourite computer games: [UFO: Enemy Unknown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO:_Enemy_Unknown).  
  
Short, but sweet. Very very sweet! (But very very short... (Quite possibly the shortest 5864 MB I've ever experienced.))  
  
I don't have/take the time to game as much as I want to/should, but this is a game that I have been looking forward to since it was announced.
