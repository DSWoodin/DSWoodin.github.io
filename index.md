# What are you doing here?

I've grouped this site into three big items:
**Learning** - a blog integrating what I've learned throughout as a high school teacher and Ph.D student  
**Doing** - some background regarding my current research at the University of New Hampshire  
**Teaching** - workflows explaining the code I use to share what I know with the masses  

See the links above for more info. See the links below for connecting with me.
