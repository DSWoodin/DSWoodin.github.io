## About convenience and automation 

I love that Azure has the capability to start and stop my Virtual Machines on a schedule using DevTestLabs. There are some great use cases of DevTestLabs for [developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-developer-lab) and some great use cases for [training](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-training-lab)

DevTestLabs has some great features but as an automation advocate I had a new requirement:

> As a user I want a button on my mobile to turn on a VM for 4 hours and it auto shuts down so that I can do some work and then the VM is turned off automatically

What could I use to meet this requirement? I had played around with [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) a little and figured out I could make buttons on the homepage of my Android phone.

Here are the tasks I decided were involved:
1. Find Azure connector for flow
1. Add task in Flow to Start Azure VM
1. Wait for x hours
1. Add task in Flow to Stop and deallocate Azure VM

It all sounded plausable and I thought this would be easy since I found the [ARM connector for flow](#)
