 Ok then, here's the greatest advice I can give:


For the rest of your life (but especially in your 20's) you are going to meet people that seem very intelligent because they can state facts, provide statistics, or quote textbooks. There's nothing wrong with using those things to *support* an argument - but those things alone do not an argument make. Those people tend to discount the greatest teacher in the world which is experience. The older you get, the less academics matter and the more life-experience *does* matter. This was something I had a very hard time understanding in my 20's. My father and I used to get in to huge arguments and he would simply say "One day you'll learn the world doesn't work that way." And he was almost always right. People think they are smart because of the facts they memorize - but memorization doesn't equal intelligence. When you encounter people like that they will debate you to do the death - but it's always easier to just write them off as inexperienced and move on with your life.
