to be “manly” does not emphasise social and emotional skills’, and that, in contrast to women, ‘the “healthy” ways men cope are by using music or exercise to manage stress or worry, rather than “talking”’.

When people defend male aggression as an inevitable part of our nature, it’s simply a way for men to avoid taking responsibility for their shitty behaviour, and allows them to inwardly justify a dangerous attitude on account of it being perceived as masculine.

It’s human nature that those with the most privilege, even when they know this is the case and recognise how unfair it is, are reluctant to give it up.

gender roles would be dictated not by what women could do but by what men could not.

The association between masculinity and the military may have been cemented centuries before WW1, but conscription revolutionised how society saw men by removing their free will and forcing them to conform. In other words, it made their masculinity compulsory.

men often took great pride in fulfilling what was expected of them: going to work and singlehandedly providing for their families gave them a sense of purpose, and in doing what only men were supposed to do, they affirmed their masculinity. As the number of women at work rose, and men watched their wives and partners get jobs, they began to lose that sense of purpose and, with it, felt their masculinity was under threat.

Toxic masculinity in its most basic form is overcompensation bred of insecurity: an exaggerated display of behaviours and actions perceived as being masculine.

As globalisation continued to change the way we did business and a particularly aggressive form of capitalism was adopted by the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, profit by any means was prioritised

there are no longer the healthy means of affirmation which kept men satisfied and secure in the past. Men need to feel secure in their masculinity, and to feel that their gender is validated somehow.

Work itself could no longer provide a sense of masculinity, so now we looked to the money.

Lad culture tries to emulate the lost working class because of its association with masculinity, but it does so in the misinformed belief that it had been a man’s social standing that gave him validation, when in actual fact it was the manual work itself.

A group of men – loud, assertive, unapologetic – know they can get away with a lot if they take the piss out of someone ‘for banter’, as they’re unlikely to be physically challenged because of their size and number.

social change being prevented not by a lack of willingness, but by one’s financial situation.

not everything we’re taught as children is to our benefit, and the attitudes we pick up from the adults around us become so deeply rooted in our minds that we often struggle to shake them off as we grow up.

there is arguably more pressure put on boys to play the ‘right’ way,

When you tell a child to override an instinct that appears right after his first breath, you’re essentially saying that all forms of emotional expression should be avoided if he wishes to appear masculine.

the inability to properly express our emotions is having a major effect on our well-being, and for the worse.

As long as it’s the norm to dress babies in gender-appropriate clothes, we are saying that gender is absolute, and that the way we present it to the world can be considered in such simplified terms as right and wrong.

My main problem is that the posters reinforce the idea that masculinity is something to strive towards, rather than telling men ‘honestly, it doesn’t fucking matter if you’re a soldier or if you do some other job that people don’t consider masculine’.

Wouldn’t it be great, though, if rather than telling men that it wasn’t emasculating to ask for help, we told them that emasculation itself wasn’t actually a thing?

No, a man’s worth is not defined by the size of his genitals, and as we’re told time and again, this isn’t a measure of one’s sexual ability – but plenty of men whether consciously or not do believe otherwise, and the fear of other people (for hetero men this especially means women) perceiving them as having tiny todgers is, remarkably, enough to effect a significant attitudinal change.

dangerous behaviour is both ‘manly’ and something to be rewarded.

Such is the ubiquity of male violence that many of us are now depressingly desensitised to it, and it feels like it comes as part and parcel in any event or place where large groups of men tend to congregate.

While violence can sometimes be explained by a mob mentality, accidents resulting from careless risk-taking seem to happen regardless of whether men are in groups or alone.

‘According to “male idiot theory” (MIT) many of the differences in risk-seeking behaviour, emergency department admissions, and mortality may be explained by the observation that men are idiots and idiots do stupid things.’

Evolutionary Neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory explores the idea that testosterone is responsible for increased levels of aggression,

Men fear emasculation – perhaps more than anything else – so they do anything they can to ensure that the image they project to others is one of masculinity, and to reassure themselves of their own social standing as men.

military and masculinity have been tied at the hip.

Young men need to be taught how their masculinity can be defined in healthy, pro-active ways: that expressing their emotions needn’t be avoided, that they can treat women decently and still be attractive to them.

a persistent trope: a man who cares about his appearance any more than is deemed normal is probably not straight.

men feel the need for defined labels and fear that any experimentation would change their fundamental personality and harm their masculinity.

Men can be at their most dangerous – to others and themselves – when they feel their masculinity has been challenged

Unrealistic beauty standards are harmful to everyone, but for modern men, the way they’re linked to our masculinity – and the fragility of this – means they’re especially dangerous.

Most toxic masculinity is a result of some sort of insecurity or fear of how others perceive you: it’s why it’s so predominantly a cis-het issue.

Being comfortable in our own thoughts is the first step towards us feeling confident enough to speak out –

when you mock an unalterable aspect of their appearance, you’re telling every innocent person who shares that characteristic that it’s something to be embarrassed about.

toxic masculinity: exaggerated behaviour intended to make oneself appear more masculine, usually prompted by insecurities, usually detached from the positive, genuine expression of masculinity it’s trying to mimic.

In a society that ascribes masculinity to money or employment, men who suddenly find themselves without one or both can easily feel their manliness is under threat.

Homophobic behaviour in a person often begins not as a hatred of gay people, but as a punishment for deviating from our societal perception of masculinity.

being professional is extremely gendered. It’s a code of behaviour and presentation designed by men for men

Since men have to conform so strictly, they can grow to resent any non-conformists, and this can manifest itself in a way that harms anyone who’s not a cis straight man.

That’s not LGBT equality – it’s letting gay people whose lifestyles conform to a straight stereotype achieve legal and social parity. It’s merely the acceptable face of homosexuality.

If we could learn to accept – not just accept, actively celebrate – all LGBT people, and not just those who act like us, there would be no default sexuality or gender identity, because we would actually see them as equals.

‘Why are white people so scared of becoming a minority in the 2040s? Are minorities treated badly in America or something?’

We are taught that our sexuality is a major defining characteristic of our personalities long before puberty sets in,

if you link misogyny to things men are ashamed about, it might make them think twice before tweeting abuse – but regardless of whether it’s effective, it perpetuates the harmful idea that a man’s worth is found in the size of his genitals or in his sex life.

Arguably, rape is often less an act of sexual desire than one of power and dominance, which is why it has been used en masse in war-torn countries as a means of oppression. It is probably the last remaining way men can exert their power over women in a purely biological sense: misogyny at its most basic.

When men are taught to value sex – particularly for the first time – above all else, it can breed a sense of entitlement and a belief that women owe them something:

It seems that for young men like the aforementioned David Sherratt, their fear of being falsely accused of rape comes not from an increase in false rape accusations, but from a culture that’s beginning to talk about sexual assault more openly and loudly than before.
