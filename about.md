title: About Me

---

My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala** in 1995, but have lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** all my life. I am deeply fond of Pune and Kerala and feel a connect to both places.
- I am currently an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of technology and Science (BITS), Pilani** pursuing **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors.
- Physics, specifically aspects of theoretical physics such as General Relativity and Quantum Theory of Fields, interest me quite a bit. Before that I was doing my schooling in Pune. Check my [academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/academic/) for more.
- I like reading, writing, listening to poetry (very recently), quizzing, and occasionally thinking about art of cinema and music. Check my [non-academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/nonacademic/) for more.
