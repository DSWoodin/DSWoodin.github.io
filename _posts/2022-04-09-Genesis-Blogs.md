Hi Everyone, This is the first blogspot which I'm writing for this new website. It's being low due from side for the process of my progress in achieving what more I do do with my career. I've been working at certain company from last few years and its been great in terms of learning but now I think its time to move forward in my career. So, To flow and track my progress this blog will play a key roles. 

## Here's what I plan to do with my blog 
- Most important of all to track my progress in learning about digital payments. i.e., ISO20022
- Also, My journey to be able to crack a product management role. 


## Track my progress of daily new learning and talk about different interesting topics. 
- I do love photography and I wanna talk about it in depth. Although I do have [Behance](https://www.behance.net/shivamnema) where I mostly keep my picture collection and I do have my  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shivamnema/). However, I will talk about pro/cons of both the platfroms in greater depth in future.
- I'm also a ardent football fan and my favorite football team is Manchester City. So, I might also wanna talk about it every now and then. 
- I'm also into blockchain/AI so I will about talk that.
- I will definetely going to talk a lot about mental health and its impact on my daily life.
- I do read a lot of books too. So, Here and there I try to write about book reviews. Which would be interesting as I've done that before. 

So, Here is mostly what I will talk about in my blog spot. I'll try to keep mostly to top two points but who knows considering my mind is cursed with multiple interests. 

Signing off.
