Fur Squared is a furry convention typically held in Brookfield, WI in February.&nbsp;

### Q: Will there be a Fur Squared in 2021?

Yes\! Fur Squared 2021 will be happening on February 26th-28th in a new, completely virtual format. **(DO NOT SHOW UP AT THE HOTEL\!)**

### Q: Why is Fur Squared virtual?

There’s kinda a pandemic out there, if you hadn’t noticed.

### Q: What about vaccines? What about treatments? What about mandatory testing? What about--

Okay, listen, we hear you. The reality is that we had a choice to make this year. We could book the regular hotel for our regular dates and hope for the best. We would have struggled to find people willing to commit to running a con in such an uncertain situation, we would have been left scrambling if a miracle didn’t appear and we had to cancel, and most importantly, we would have been putting our attendees, staff, and hotel staff in danger. Or we could do what we chose to do instead: plan to go virtual from the beginning and spend our time creating the best online convention experience we could\! The staff sees this as an exciting new challenge and an opportunity to help bring people together during times when everyone could use a friend.

### Q: So, Fur Squared is going virtual. Do I need to pay up for a VR rig to join in?

Nope\! VRChat will be a part of the convention, but it will not be the sole focus. The programming, dealer’s den, and artist alley will all be streaming-based with no VR necessary\! VRChat will host a weekend-long social space, but we will also have Discord as a non-VR alternative for socializing. The only things that will be completely VR-exclusive are some games and activities that require a physical space or environment, and even then, VRChat is entirely playable without a VR headset or controllers.

### Q: How can I keep up with what’s happening with the con?

We’ll be posting updates here on the website as well as on Twitter at [http://www.twitter.com/fursquared](http://www.twitter.com/fursquared) and on Telegram at [https://t.me/fursquared](https://t.me/fursquared)\!&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Q: I have a question not on this page. What can I do?

Some things that you don’t see here are things we haven’t announced yet\! This page will be updated as we release more information.
