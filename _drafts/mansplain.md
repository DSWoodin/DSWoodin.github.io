 Mine does it too but in a slightly different way. I'll talk about something I'm quite confident about because e.g. I've read about it recently and then he will 'correct' me (in a really assured way) but what he's saying is completely wrong and just based on 'feeling'! He's done it enough to be a pattern, although I have brought it up and he is making a point to acknowledge it. It feels shitty that his assumptions take precedence over my knowledge.
