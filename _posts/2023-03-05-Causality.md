Domingo, Sunday.<br>
Got home semi-dead and took a nap, I saw myself in a dream writing about causality, so here I am.

**Hello!**<br>
How is everything going?<br>
It's been a while, 3 months, wow... And I still have to write some other posts, pfff.<br>
Let me tell you a little about these 3 months, they were super calm, and I used them to think about a lot of things<br> 
It felt like it was the calm before the storm, and when the storm came, this time I was damn ready.<br>
And I am glad to inform you: <br>
### ***The dog days are over.***
And let that mean, whatever you want it to mean :b

### ***And why is that important?***<br>
Because, this long process of healing and growing started when by mistake I bought a notebook I didn't need, so one day when I was about to swallow all of my anger, I took the notebook and started writing letters to an old friend of mine, it took me a couple of weeks but **I filled 80 pages**, and once I was done, I felt like **I was ready to move on.**<br>
So I stood up slowly, with a lot of fear, and after a few weeks, I knew it, **it was over**.

And that my friends, is what I consider ***causality***.

### ***What is causality?***
_'Causality is universal. Nowhere in the world can there be any phenomena that do not give rise to certain consequences and have not been caused by other phenomena. Ours is a world of cause and effect or, figuratively speaking, of progenitors and their progeny. Whenever we seek to retrace the steps of cause and effect and find the first cause, it disappears into the infinite distances of universal interaction. But the concept of cause is not confined to interaction. Causality is only a part of universal connection.'_<br>
<cite>-Dialectical Materialism (A. Spirkin)</cite>

And well, that's the best serious definition I can find, but allow me to explain it my way.
Causality is everything in our world, every decision we make and every step we take can lead to some crazy outcome, and yes, that sounds much like **Butterfly effect**.<br>
But I also believe in causality as some kind of weird way of destination, there are things that are supposed to happen a certain way, and when you make decisions that are trying to escape from that outcome, causality comes into play.<br>
And what I believe: ***Causality fixes itself, ONLY IF it needs to be fixed.***

And this is important for me, because there are moments in my life in which I think:<br>
"Well, these are just casualties playing altogether around me", but when there are too many casualties, **I just know is causality fixing something.**<br>
It is causality planning something, something maybe already happened, and that's why of the casualties.<br>

And causality can't act in big ways, or big events, it acts as small but progressively stunning butterfly effects.<br>
And there exist some specific points in my life, in which I see everything around me and I just know<br> 
**I was meant to be there, I was meant to do this**, because causality wanted it that way.<br>
And **I can't escape causality, for better or worse.**<br>

That's why many times, I just take some illogical decisions, because if causality lead me to that moment, it was for something, and maybe **I can't escape that.**<br>
And trust me, when I tried to escape it, I was taken back, time after time, until it was done the way it was meant to be.<br>

**I believe in causality**, as some people believe in God.<br>
I believe that many repeating random casualties are just not to be ignored, but to be taken as a guide of what to do next.<br>
I believe in the power and massiveness of a butterfly effect, **so dumb as picking up a wrong notebook**, can change the way your life goes.<br>
**So small as wanting to skip 3 days of classes back in 8th grade**, lead me to be the person I am right now.<br>
**So ridiculous as sending a text message to the wrong person at 1 am**, lead me to watch a series that changed my life and guided my way of behaving.<br>
Life, universe, God, causality, etc... just acts in mysterious ways. Ways sometimes we can't control, we can't ignore our gut, and we can't fight. <br>

**IT IS JUST MEANT TO BE.**<br>

Causality drives us to places, we never imagined we could be in.<br>

***I can't fight causality, and I won't ignore it.***

And one last thing for today:
## Cheer up universe, I am back, [I am ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIXQjSo4GCE).
