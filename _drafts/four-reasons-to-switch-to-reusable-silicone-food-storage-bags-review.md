I've been eyeing these reusable food storage silicone bags since I heard of them, so I could not say no when [slidensealpouches](https://www.slidensealpouches.com/) reached out to me to try them (disclaimer: I was gifted a set). I've been using the resealable bags for x time now and I am a convert. I love them. Honestly, anything that makes my home, especially my kitchen more streamlined, I'm game - within reason, of course. As I also value being frugal with things and having less. These bags are definitely very reasonable too in price and function and space saving. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you four reasons to switch to reusable silicone food storage bags plus my review of the product I tried that I was gifted. _Make sure to scroll to the end for a coupon code too._  
  
Thinking of making the switch to reusable food bags too? Here are my four favorite reasons to switch to reusable silicone food storage bags:

1. I love that I can take them and reheat leftovers right in the microwave!! Please remove the slide first. 
2. Reusable (obviously). Not a one and done plastic food bag. 
3. They take up less space in the fridge and storage cupboard vs glass containers we usually use. Much appreciated with our big family and fridge space. 
4. They are dishwasher safe and easy to clean. 

My only negative is that it was a little tricky to close with plastic closure. Worried about possibly losing them as they are not attached.  
  
All in all? I love them. I'm a convert for sure!
