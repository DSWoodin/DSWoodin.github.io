Hello! I am Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Public Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/) at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/) and [In&#234;s Azevedo](http://www.inesazevedo.org/).
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and electric power systems, using algorithmic and policy analytic approaches to promote efficient and low-emission operation of the energy grid.
I am funded through the U.S. Department of Energy's [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and was previously an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

Before CMU, I was a [Thomas J. Watson Fellow](https://watson.foundation/) traveling the world to study the people, technologies, and policies behind next-generation electricity systems (project blog [here](https://priyaswatson.wordpress.com/)). I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College in Computer Science/Math with an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis.
