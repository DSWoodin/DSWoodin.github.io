  <p>Medicine is the only thing by which we use where we feel bad condition of our body physical and mental illness. Most of medicines made of specific plants from our nature. These plants are also known as a medicinal plant. All the traditional Bangladeshi medical systems namely Ayurveda, Unani , Homeopathy prominently use medicinal plants. So, it is important to classify the right plant for medical preparation. The ability of identify these plants automatically is need in recent days. For this we proposed a renowned algorithm called Convolutional neural network for recognizing the plants from leaf image. Our algorithm got 84.58% accuracy. We developed this by us. We believe that in future the individuals who don’t distinguish medicinal plants they will recognize using this methodology.</p>

<p>Question answering is a set of tools for obtaining detailed answers from user questions. At present, it is gaining very popularity day by day in the area of NLP research. There is a lot of work done in English. Still, become the seventh spoken language has not notable development at all. In Bengali very little work we've seen so far. Many types of problems can be solved by answering questions. Automatic question answering system is very much needed to solve various problems through Q&A. It is a very challenging task to create this type of system. In our paper we developed an automatic context based Question&Answering system using sequence to sequence architecture. An encoder layer will be used with a bi-directional LSTM and a decoder layer followed by an attention mechanism. The main challenge of this work is - data collection, finding the right vocabulary for word mapping and lots more. The main function of our model is to answer the questions. We have been able to successfully answer the question and reduce our training loss to 0.003.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Sentiment Analysis is a technique related to text analysis and natural language processing used to detect various types of insights or information from a portion of text. Over the past few years, researchers have done many works regarding this. In Bangladesh, many online services like-e-com become very popular day by day. One of them is online food delivery services. We can order various foods of our choice from online and sometimes people gives reviews based on that food. Those reviews are usually discarded as unstructured data which of them have no work in further. In this piece of research focus primarily on those unstructured data to analyze them in a correct manner to find insight into customers' behavior and their reactions on those online platforms. To do this experiment first we collect data from websites. Later deep learning-based techniques applied here. For baseline structure, we have used both CNN and LSTM models. Then for improving the model accuracy an attention mechanism applied followed by CNN which gives us 98.45% accuracy. We've also evaluated our model performances with some evaluation metrics also. From them, CNN based attention model gives a higher f1-score of 0.93.</p>

  <p>Headline is called the soul of news. Headline carries a very important meaning. Generally, many people start reading the news after seeing the headlines. It is very important for the user to classify the headlines that he/she preferred. Classifying news type based on their headlines is a problem of text classification which lies under natural language processing (NLP) research. In different languages, there are many works done but none of them observed in Bengali. In our work we tried to visualize our very first approach to solve this problem. A LSTM-based architecture is used for solving this problem. A total of 4580 headlines are trained in our model. Finally, our model gives us 91.22% accuracy. The main challenge of our work is finding the right word vector. As far headlines are made up with different types of words and there is no similarity between any of them, so it is difficult to map them.</p>

  <p>More than 130 million people in Bangladesh depends on riceas  their  main  food.  Half  of  the  employment  of  the  rural  area  and  theagricultural GDP of Bangladesh depends on rice production. Nearly morethan 10 million farmer families cultivate rice in Bangladesh. Almost 10% of rice cultivation is depreciated by different types of rice plant diseasescaused by pests This is the reason why we worked on detecting rice plant(Oryza sativa)disease  by  visual  observation(images). 3265  images  ofrice plant disease have been collected for this study which belongs to 4classes: Hispa, Brown Spot, Leaf Blast and the healthy ones. The imagesof diseased leaf are collected from rice fields. We have used a pre-trainedmodel for classification and extracting features.By using this model wegot a incentive results with the accuracy rate of 93.21%. </p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>There have recently been many cases of unverified or misleading information circulating quickly over bogus web networks and news portals. This false news creates big damage to society and misleads people. For Example, in 2019 there was a rumor that the Padma Bridge of Bangladesh needed 100,000 human heads for sacrifice. This rumor turns into a deadly position and this misleading information takes the lives of innocent people. There is a lot of work in English but a few works in Bangla. In this study, we are going to identify the fake news from the unconsidered news source to provide the newsreader with natural news or real news. The paper is based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) where CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. The first thing we did to deploy this piece of work was data collection. We compiled a data set from websites and attempted to deploy it using the methodology of deep learning which contains about 50k of news. With the proposed model of Multichannel combined CNN-LSTM architecture, our model gained an accuracy of 75.05% which is a good sign for detecting fake news in Bangla.</p>
