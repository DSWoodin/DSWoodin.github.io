# What I like to do:
## Sports 
#### Snowboarding

Since I live in Canada every year there's about 4 months that I get to snowboard. The terrain park is where I spend most of my time if it's smaller hill, and I enjoy the glades on larger mountains. 

These are the places I've been to so far:
* Dagmar (ON)
* Mount St. Louis Moonstone (ON)
* Horseshoe Valley (ON)
* Snowvalley (ON)
* Mont-Tremblant (QC)

Here's a small clip of me in 2020:
