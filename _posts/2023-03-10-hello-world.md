The minimum viable product is ready to be available on the ZD store, and I've sent the app for approval. This post is actually more for testing purposes, since I've been working on this site.

To submit the application I need to have 3 screenshots of the application in a 1024x768 format, which kind of sucks, because the images became, in my opinion, bad. Here they are, can you please comment?
