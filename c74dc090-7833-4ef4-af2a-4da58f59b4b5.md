 WLB is actually pretty good (minus some teams but def in minority, team to team and org to org can vary **a lot** in bigN), that would be one of the pluses actually imo. Like 90%+ I would say are not overworked, if not more than that. e.g. Cloud sector in all the companies are prob the most overworked given the competition, the other ones are pretty good. Easiest way to find out unfortunately would be just know someone in that company and ask them, word gets around the grapevine really fast what the good and bad orgs/teams are but obviously not everyone has access to that. Otherwise, it is hard to get a straight answer.

I worked way more for a start up than I've ever worked at a BigN. Though mid-sized company in midwest was the literal best WLB, like almost never more than 35 hrs a week and WFH whenever. Granted, I don't have enough of a life to take advantage of that but that's neither here or there.

The answer probably isn't "this type of person won't like BigN", but rather: if you don't like a lot of the following things I will list below you prob won't like BigN (disclaimer: this is intentionally a very lopsided list and will take me forever to go into detail so also intentionally left vague (though if one is particularly interesting feel free to ask me to expand), also no one (hopefully) has to experience all of these at once, this is more of a meta list from colleagues who have left or expressed frustration):

1. Things are really slow, like order of magnitudes slower than start ups
2. You don't get to solve "common" problems most of the time, you solve problems most companies never have to solve. While that might sound cool, those skills are a lot less transferable.
3. Similarly, all BigN have internal exclusive tech no one's ever heard of.
4. Can be really boring cause all the "common" problems are solved so you just glue other people's solutions together
5. Tons of legacy code
6. Tons of legacy documentation and tribal knowledge
7. Everything stable is "deprecated" and their PMs push you to use the replacement that's honestly not ready resulting in point 1 about being slow but now you also got people annoying you
8. So much to learn that a lot of times when you need help and can't find anyone to help you, you become the expert having just learned that thing
9. Hard to have big / lasting impact on the whole company with that scale whereas that's super simple at start ups
10. Promos (even for people who def deserve them) can be extremely slow, esp past senior/staff level, not to mention people can usually get director+ of engineering gigs after leaving BigN so... why not right?
11. Takes forever to fire useless people; BigN is a left-skewed normal distribution of good engineers but by definition that still leaves tons of dumb people (with the scale we're talking about) on the table but PIP and firing takes forever cause they don't want to get sued, and now one of those people is your mentee...........
12. Easy to get in positions where you're not doing what you like, even with the internal transfer process, e.g. staff engineers that are triple booked in meetings and get like 2 hours a week to code
13. Too many hands in the pie for every project
14. 10 million stupid questions from people playing politics with your project
15. Useless people who don't know they're useless (I know I'm harping now, but I've seen one bad apple spoils the entire dev team one too many times, granted this is everywhere but smaller companies can people waayyyy faster)
16. A lot of corporate hug-box stuff, everyone can feel super fake (not like everyone's walking on eggshells or anything like that, but as soon as you hang out with one or more colleagues casually you see everyone, usually, acts super different at work; not necessarily a con I suppose but some people much prefer a more authentic start up feel)
17. Top down initiatives fucking your whole dev cycle and process cause even at staff+ level you got like 6 bosses
18. Interruptions, especially when you own more and more stuff, the number of questions grows exponentially, email and IM management becomes a core job requirement

This is just off the top of my head. Though, keep in mind my disclaimer and the fact that *despite* all of that, I still very much enjoy my job and it's def not because of the paycheck =)

Honestly, I would just say just give one or two a try (I know I'm being very casual about this, but I really don't think BigN should be on the pedestle that they're on and one way to do that is be more casual about it :p), I can talk all day about pros and cons but at the end of the day I'm not you and you're not me, personal experience will always trump hearsay. And I don't know your background either, if the paycheck is life changing money and can pull your entire family out of poverty, my list probably reads like some entitled asshole on his ivory tower bitching about not enough lobster at lunch (and rightfully so).
