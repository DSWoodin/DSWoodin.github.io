## 1. Soccer team

![seccer team](/assets/img/designathon/mermaid-diagram-2024-02-26-102446.png)

1. Player-Team: Each player belongs to exactly one team.
2. Team-Players: Teams consist of multiple players.
3. Match-Team: Teams participate in matches, with each match involving multiple teams.
4. Match-Players: Matches feature many players, indicating broad participation across events.

```bash
erDiagram
    PLAYER ||--|| TEAM : "belong"
    TEAM ||--o{ PLAYERS : "has many"
    MATCHES }o--o{ TEAM : "participate"
    MATCHES ||--o{ PLAYERS : "have many"
```

- A player belongs a team
- A team participates many matches
- A team has many players
- Players have many matches

## 2. The companyDB

![company](/assets/img/designathon/mermaid-diagram-2024-03-04-184246.png)

1. Company-Employee: A "One-to-Many" relationship, indicating that a company employs many employees, but each employee works for a single company.
2. Company-Project: Another "One-to-Many" relationship, showing that a company can have multiple projects, with each project belonging to one company.
3. Employee-Project (involved in many): This represents a "Many-to-Many" relationship. Employees can be involved in many projects, and projects can have many employees working on them.
4. Project-Employee (has many): While appearing similar to the above, this contextually suggests the allocation of employees to projects, typically reflecting roles or responsibilities within those projects.
5. Employee-Manager: A "One-to-One" relationship, indicating that each employee reports to a single manager. This relationship is unique and exclusive, showing a direct reporting line.
6. Employee-Project (manages): A "One-to-Many" relationship, where an employee (likely in a managerial or leadership role) manages multiple projects, showcasing the responsibility of project oversight.

```bash
erDiagram
COMPANY {
        string CompanyID PK
        string Name
        string Zip
        string Country
        string Address1
        string State
        number Employed_staff_number

    }
    EMPLOYEE {
        string EmployeeID PK
        string ProjectMangerID
        string Name
        string role
        string Team
    }
    PROJECT {
        string ProjectID PK
        string ProjectName
        string EmployeeID FK
        string Location
        string Budget
    }
    MANAGER {
        string ManagerID PK
        string EmployeeID FK
        string Name
        string role
        string Team
    }

    COMPANY ||--o{ EMPLOYEE : "has many"
    COMPANY ||--o{ PROJECT : "has many"
    EMPLOYEE ||--o{ PROJECT : "involved in many"
    PROJECT ||--o{ EMPLOYEE : "has many"
    EMPLOYEE ||--|| MANAGER : "reports to"
    EMPLOYEE ||--|{ PROJECT : "manages"
```

## 3. Academic Social Network

![academia](/assets/img/designathon/mermaid-diagram-2024-03-04-181937.png)

I made this diagram for having academic social network. First, I made user equity to let users have a account. User can create account including name, email, and address. I can identify user based on the userId as a prime key. Since pages are created when courses are made. I used course_id as a foreign key and then include name and code in the courses entity. Finally, users can made posts in a page and create comments in posts.

1. Users-Friendship Requests: Users can send multiple friendship requests, but each request is from a single user.
2. Courses-Pages: Each course is directly associated with a single, specific page.
3. Users-Posts: Users can create multiple posts, with each post attributed to one user.
4. Users-Courses: Users can subscribe to many courses, indicating a user's enrollment or interest in various educational subjects.
5. Users-Comments: Users can make multiple comments on posts or pages, with each comment made by one user.
6. Posts-Comments: Each post can have multiple comments, indicating engagement and discussion generated by the content.

```bash
erDiagram
    USERS {
        string user_id PK
        string name
        string email
        string address
    }

    PAGES {
        string page_id pk
        string course_id FK
        datetime createdAt
    }

    COURSES {
        string course_id PK
        string name
        string code
    }

    POSTS {
        string post_id PK
        string content
        string user_id FK
        string course_id FK
        string page_id FK
        datetime createdAt
    }

    COMMENTS {
        string comment_id PK
        string content
        string user_id FK
        string post_id FK
        string page_id FK
        datetime createdAt
    }

    FRIENDSHIP_REQUESTS {
        string request_id PK
        string sender_user_id FK
        string receiver_user_id FK
        boolean status
    }

    USERS ||--o{ FRIENDSHIP_REQUESTS : "send requests"
    COURSES ||--|| PAGES : "have"
    USERS ||--o{ POSTS : "creates"
    USERS ||--o{ COURSES : "subscribe"
    USERS ||--o{ COMMENTS : "creates"
    POSTS ||--o{ COMMENTS : "has"
```
