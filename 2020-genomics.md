title: 2020 Genomics Workshop
---

We will be hosting a Genomics workshop at [USC Wrigley Institute](https://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/wmsc/) on Catalina Island from August 15 to August 19, 2020.  We aim to bring together 50 researchers with expertise in genomics, marine science, evolutionary biology, and oceanography. The workshop will have a combination of oral presentations, poster sessions, discussions, and brainstorming sessions. The objectives, themes, and schedule [can be viewed here](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/GenomicsWorkshop/blob/master/README.md)

Information will be sent out on the Research Coordinated Network's [list serve](https://listserv.neu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=RCN-ECS&A=1), so be sure to sign up to receive updates.
