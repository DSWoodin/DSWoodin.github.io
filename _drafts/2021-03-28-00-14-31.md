hello friends i'm matt baume so last

week Mary Cheney asked why blackface is

bad but drag isn't here's what she wrote

why is it socially acceptable for men to

put on dresses makeup and high heels and

act out every offensive stereotype

[ __ ] catty dumb [ __ ] etc but it is

not socially acceptable for a white

person to put on blackface and act out

offensive stereotypes of African

Americans shouldn't both be okay or

neither and can you believe that made

people upset usually my videos are about

what's happening with marriage equality

over on my show marriage news watch but

I have to weigh in here because I love

drag I work with drag queens and I've

seen a lot of people who just don't know

how to answer her question even if we

think it's a dumb question we should

have a smart simple answer so let's talk

about it

why is drag different from blackface and

on the surface yeah there are

similarities between blackface and drag

they're both one group posing as another

group they both rely on exaggerated

stereotypes and they're both

over-the-top caricatures but blackface

is inherently racist you can't take the

racism out of it drag on the other hand

you can easily separate from misogyny

most drag in fact almost all drag is

about strong powerful admirable female

characters with blackface black people

are the butt of the joke but with drag

it's not women who are the butt of the

joke but rules about gender roles nobody

looks at a drag queen and things oh yeah

that's what real women are actually like

the way that a lot of Americans did with

black face and minstrel shows and

there's something else going on with

drag unlike stock minstrel characters

drag performers are a personal

expression of the performer drag queens

aren't just imitating female stereotypes

they're expressing how fluid their own

gender can be that's why a performers

drag name and drag family and drag

costume are so important to them

blackface performers on the other hand

aren't expressing anything internal

they're not asserting their personal

racial fluidity all that blackface does

is lie about what people of color are

like now there is of course bad drag bad

drag is just a man wearing a dress not

making any effort to perform or create a

character or express anything with bad

drag the whole joke is that it

supposedly

embarrassing for a man to be seen acting

feminine that's not real drag

that's just ridiculing women and queers

and if you want to be fancy about it

perpetuating the cycle of patriarchal

hegemony that's bad

I'm saying that drag is not demeaning to

women but maybe you shouldn't completely

take my word for it because I'm not a

woman a lot of the people publicly

weighing in right now are men and that's

great but since we're talking about how

drag affects women it's important to you

know actually listen to what women are

saying about it and this gets to another

difference between drag and blackface

not only are women not usually offended

by drag but women actually perform drag

themselves even little girls perform

drag when they dress up as princesses

these are exaggerated feminine

characters an expression of the

attraction to or curiosity about gender

roles drag is how you explore who you

are or who you can become

as RuPaul says were born naked and then

the rest is drag no one has ever said

we're born naked and the rest is a

minstrel show so let's sum it up next

time someone asks you why drag is okay

and blackface isn't you can tell them

that drag is an expression of yourself

and blackface is an attack on someone

else blackface reinforces an imbalance

of power and drag disassembles an

imbalance of power blackface is a relic

and drag is what we all do every day

every time we put on clothes so

hopefully that clears things up and the

next time we're talking about Mary

Cheney we're instead talking about how

she supports the disastrous Keystone

pipeline or how she donated money to

Republican candidates who opposed the

Freedom to Marry like Mitt Romney and

Kelly Ayotte and Rob Portman before he

changed his mind and Sam Brownback for

crying out loud in 2012 governor

Brownback recommended that Kansas

actually keep a law that would allow

police officers to arrest you simply for

being gay apparently Cheney liked that

so much that two years later her

consulting firm spent over half a

million dollars supporting Brownback's

re-election

she also supported the re-election of

Florida Governor Rick McCallum he's the

guy who hired X gay abuser George recurs

to testify against the Freedom to Marry

recurs was later spotted returning from

a European vacation with the rent boy

and we really haven't heard that much

from him since then

so if Mary really

wants to talk about LGBT issues maybe

she could start by apologizing for any

number of those mistakes or for

completely misrepresenting what drag is

when she wrote last week that performers

act out every offensive stereotype of

women [ __ ] caddies dumb [ __ ] etc in

a million years that is not even a

fragment of what drag is if she really

misunderstands drag that deeply maybe

she should spend a little less time with

Sam Brownback and a little more time

with other gay people big thanks to all

my friends who commented on Facebook

about this issue and messaged me

privately to share your thoughts

I couldn't have articulated any of this

without your help so please keep talking

let me know what you think I'm at Matt

bell on Twitter and if you're in Seattle

sometime let's go catch a drag show

goodnight
