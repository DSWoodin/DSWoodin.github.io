My name is Ziliang Luo. A Ph.D. student at Agronomy Department of University of Florida

- I'm interested in Biological Nitrogen fixation System in legume species. Study on BNF genetics could facilitate transfering this magic power to food crops, which will greatly reduce the chemical input into field and environment.
- Super interested in bioinformatics.
- I love Broadway musicals, American football, dogs, nature.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
