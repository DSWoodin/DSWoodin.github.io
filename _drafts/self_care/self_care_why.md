 Hey OP, are you OK? 

I made this account about a year ago during the absolute worst period of my life. I had to, through little fault of my own, restart my life using one outfit I had on, a wallet with 79 cents in it, and my driver’s license and social security card. These were my assets. All the physical and the financial ones were gone (married, joint accounts, we were renting a house, I came back one day to literally nothing. He took my bras and underwear! Why couldn’t I get like 1/50th of the collective assets? This was stupider than it had to be).

It absolutely sucked, but I was able to get back to where I was in life within one year, through all that pain and homelessness and suck. I didn’t do it alone. People like those on reddit helped a lot, and if you need something, let me know? I can help. Like do you have food and a place to be right now?

If you’re in an emergency, or you’re struggling just because stuff is kind of shitty right now and it used to be better, it’s very important to prioritize self care, every day. I’m talking do something that brings you joy, every day. Walking is easier because it’s free. You have access to the internet somehow, use it to figure out somewhere cool to go near you where you’ve never been. Maybe it’s just a neat sidewalk with cool phases printed on it. The point is doing something small like this will help remind you that the world is still cool and can still surprise you with how cool it is.

You’re going to want to avoid **“diseases of despair.”** If life sucks right now, you do not have the bandwidth to fall into substance abuse. Nobody wakes up one day and says “I’m going to develop a crippling addiction today,” but maybe at one point you find a pill that makes you feel normal or helps you forget some bad stuff, and it’s hard to say no to that once it starts. **

If you don’t physically move yourself, like move your body in some way, the depression monster will eat you. Move stuff. Find one thing to do every day and accomplish the thing. Maybe you found a cool place to shower and have some shower stuff and you’re clean and that’s what you did today. That’s not nothing. Be proud of that. You didn’t do nothing today. Start finding victories like this, it’s called “positive self-talk,” because sometimes the difference between your cosy house and your shitty rental in a garbage place you’re never going to escape because your plans were derailed by illness or whatever is 90% your attitude about yourself and your circumstances.

Things will get better. It might suck for a while and you gotta do something every day. But if you do something every day, it gets easier.

Find some connection to people that works for you. Maybe you’re poor and so you don’t want to go out among people. There is a group for everything. I found one for people going through divorces that was aces. Had to go through a couple bad ones first, but find good energy. It’s warm and there’s at least coffee there. People who have board gams are generally nice and just want someone to talk to/play board games with, in my experience. It’s an activity for solitary people who don’t really want to be solitary. They’ll teach you, just be nice and willing to put some time in. Then boom, new friend maybe.

Serious about support groups though. Some weeks you don’t have a clear victory, like you were just trying to eat and shower everyday, you hadn’t found the right work yet so maybe you’re just doing whatever or maybe you’re heading over to the plasma center and using your old address on the paperwork. It sucks. But maybe someone else had a victory, and then you all get to celebrate, it gives you hope for the day you will emerge from the shit. And if you don’t go to shit, that will happen. Promise. You gotta do something every day. But it can change.

My alone activity was like...law school for a year, I needed to feel like my identity wasn’t “hopeless loser” and I happened to have test scores on file. Solved my housing problem until I could find a job in the field I used to work in, and that took time, because it was a professional job and those aren’t just anywhere. 

But another thing I did that’s paying some dividends? Learned Spanish. It was nice for me because I knew some other languages and was willing to sit down with YouTube. Made me smile to figure something out, I could talk to more people. Like I didn’t do a great job with it, but I can generally ask how people are, understand their answers, know directions, express gratitude or ask questions. It’s not perfect but I get better sometimes, and people like when you put in effort to speak their language, even if you suck a bit and aren’t perfect with idioms or have an accent. Like whatever, you still came to the party and did your best, we like you more.

I hope something in here might help you. You’re never hopeless. You can bounce back from a lot of things and our stories aren’t final until we’re dead.
