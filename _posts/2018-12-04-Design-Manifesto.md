#### Think outside of your box/bubble

People inevitably go into the experience of working on a long term design project with various preconceptions of what they want to make and why, especially if the project is one that involves considerable creativity with team members developing a sense of a personal or emotional stake in the functionality and success of the design. I am no exception – going into the early stages of planning a design project to promote user engagement at the Williams College Museum of Art, I had various disjoint yet specific visions for what my design could be. These ideas proved stubborn to disregard – I found myself leaning towards ideas that drew from my own experiences in museums and continually suggesting things to my group members that pushed our brainstorming in the direction of my own experience, without paying much attention to our need to broaden the scope of personas that might use our design. This is a slippery slope and an especially dangerous one to find yourself on in the early stages of the design process. 

My experience with creative projects usually involved coming up with an idea and then building it while making adjustments along the way – the notions of coming up with ideas iteratively and using feedback directly from my target user base to adjust my brainstorming were unfamiliar and felt almost unnatural to me. However, this process of actively seeking out information from people with different perspectives than myself and incorporating this wider reservoir of experience into my brainstorming process proved to be the most illuminating step of my design process. 

### Iterate, iterate, then iterate more!

A designer can have access to all kinds of useful information, they can even take the time to seek out such information, but if they are so attached to their original preconceptions of their design that they are unwilling to take new, potentially conflicting data into account then all of their efforts will have been for naught. It is always necessary to change one’s approach the moment new data contradicts previous assumptions. For that crucial reason and many others, it is necessary to iterate continuously throughout the design process and to think critically about how each iteration can improve on the last.

To further illustrate the power of iterative designing, consider the example of my project SWCMA and how my team and I were able to successfully streamline the design into a more usable result by repeatedly rethinking and redesigning our product based on input from participants in contextual inquiries and usability tests. More specifically, in our final usability test, we discovered that each of our three diverse users (one college student with an interest in art, one without, and a community member who does not attend the school but likes art) did not understand what our product was meant to do and found that our functions did not connect to our tasks in the way that we had hoped. This helped us step away from our design, an app meant to improve visitors’ agency when navigating gallery halls and encourage them to save and share pieces that they connect with, and notice that we had combined cumbersome hardware with too many confusing menus that did too many things. Negative reactions from participants in our usability tests helped us notice something that we were too close to the product to see ourselves: we had unintentionally obfuscated the core purposes of our product such that users did not know what to do with our app. We immediately knew what had to be done: strip away the unnecessary hardware and menus and build an app that focuses directly on our tasks. We were able to arrive at this decision not only because of our willingness to listen to outsiders but also because we took the time to reimagine our product from different angles and adjust its design accordingly. 

### Work to make things accessible every step of the way



### Don't be afraid to steal: many of the most important ideas come from outside your own head



### Devote time to ethical considerations

#### Definition



#### Considering implications



#### Who am I building for?



#### Anticipate problems/possibility of causing harm
