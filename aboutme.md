# About me

My name is Maxim Gorbatyuk, and I am from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Also I am:

- Senior software engineer at EPAM company
- .NET developer
- Angular developer
- interested in project management and team leading
- addicted to getting new knowledge, skiing, snowboarding, hiking and Starbacks coffee

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
