# Introduction

## Linux processes

### What is Kernel?

**Kernal** is a fundamental component of a computer's operating system, such as Linux. Unlike direct communication with hardware, applications interact with the hardware through the kernel. Users issue commands to the operating system, which then translates these into actions to be performed by the hardware. This process is facilitated by a syscall (system call) instruction, a request from an application to the kernel to perform a specific operation. The kernel reviews the request to ensure it's valid before executing the action on the application's behalf.
