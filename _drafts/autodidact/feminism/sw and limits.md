Assuming a prostitute will have sex with you for money then behaving as if that assumption means you’re entitled to the implications of your assumption is largely problematic. And speaking colloquially about that issue without acknowledging the inherent problems with the view society has generally of sex workers proliferates that issue and, for me, definitely counts as ‘dunking on sex workers.’

There are many toxic ‘truths’ in our society that are dangerous for various disenfranchised groups. By ‘truths,’ I mean ideas that are not true in reality but have been canonized by decades/millennia of patriarchal history: “Black men are dangerous!” “Non American Hispanics are murderers and rapists!” “Women are manipulative and volatile!” “Asians are dirty disease carriers!” 

It can be difficult sometimes to rewrite our brains so that we understand why society’s truths aren’t always real or good. That’s why I find that it’s good to reflect on the things we say without much thought when others point out that certain opinions, even if they are ‘truths,’ are hurtful. 

Why would we say, “he’s treating her like a prostitute!” but not, “he’s treating her like a plumber!”? Because people don’t generally decide that other people owe them a service just because it’s that other person’s liveliehood. But sex workers don’t get the same consideration as other people because many in our society do not see sex workers as people. 

“He’s treating her like a prostitute!” implies Ben’s made a simple mistake about AOC’s profession, as if his behavior of offering money for a service was doomed to fail solely because he was wrong about who he is talking to. 

We’ve already hashed out that whole issue of whether a person must serve a client they do not wish to serve—remember those gay wedding cakes?

So why would we say someone who is offering money for a service, but who behaves as if they are owed that service regardless, is treating that other person like a prostitute? Because society has told us that sex workers, unlike plumbers, are not real people who should be allowed the discretion to choose their clientele. And that’s a very real issue for the many, many women and men who are hurt because of their occupation. 

Also just gonna add that many sex workers aren’t truly free to decide whether they will do sex work for money at all. So it’s especially dangerous for them when we further dismiss their autonomy by implying they must perform their services for anyone that offers them money.

Edit: edited a couple times to clarify wording and finish some half sentences I’d decided to leave in the dust of my tab key.


Sex workers are a marginalized group of people. You should be listening when they express that something harmful has been said. They know what harms them better than you. 


I have limits, and my friends who are sex workers have limits too. Perpetuating the idea that we do not causes us more harm than you can imagine. About half the clients I interact with believe we do not have limits, and some of them get angry when I have limits. They get these ideas from popular culture surrounding sex workers. The only way to change this is by pushing back against that narrative every time it pops up. Even when it pops up and seems like something harmless to you.
