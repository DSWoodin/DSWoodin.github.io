From 3 month ago, I started to new job. I need to improve english (especially speaking) because new company consist of colleagues speaking english.
Unlike before, There are a lot of contents to help study english.  I Know there is a best way, but I thought there would be a way to learn English that suits me. So I tried various way to learn English such as shadowing, listening to english article, watching disney with english subtitle.

All of way are good, but I missed which skill is my main prioority. I have many oppotunity to explain something to my colleagues, so I should focus speaking thant othter skills. As result of I've figured out, I found the way suits me. It's not special way.

Just memorize words and catch the 뉘앙쓰, and then make my own sentence multiple times. It more effective way than just memorizing.
