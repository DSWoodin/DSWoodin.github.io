Math club members are expected to regularly attend our weekly practice sessions on Fridays from 2:50-4:00 in Red Cedar pod.

# Varsity
The Varsity room is for members of our Varsity group, which is an earn-in group formed within the math club.
Membership qualification is objective and based purely on performance in math competitions.
The focus of this group is to provide in-depth training on advanced topics for the students who have proven 
results in middle school math competitions. Every sanctioned competition will provide an opportunity for any 
student to earn their way into the group moving forward. Once in the group, weekly homework and attendance is
mandatory, and those who do not participate are at risk of relegation.
