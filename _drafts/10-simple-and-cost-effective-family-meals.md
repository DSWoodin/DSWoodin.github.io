I love getting meal inspiration from other families just like ours, so thought I'd write down all of our simple and cost effective family meals here for you. Hopefully you find something new to try. Tag me on instagram @simplehomemom if you do!  
  
Why simple meals?  
  
Because life is busy and most of the time kids do better with simple rather than elaborate meals..and plus less prep time for us. The ideal situation, right? I'm a fan of quick, healthy meals that get repeated often. I'll be sharing or most popular and most eatned meals in this blog for you today. They are in no particulr order.  
  
Nachos  
This is one of our "fun" meals.   
Ingredients:  
Doritos, any flavour  
Shredded cheese  
Any variation of meat and veggies such as:  
peppers, onions, hot peppers, green onions, tomato, ham bits, bacon, chicken  
Serve on their own after broiling in the over or with sour cream and/or salsa.  
  
If we're feeling like splurging a little, we buy Doritos and use those for the nachos. It's sooooo tasty!  
  
Picky plates  
  
Picky plates or finger foods are what we do for most of our lunches. I put them in a round container with separated sections. I use my picky plate planner page from my Simple Meal Planning Guide to plan it out. I make sure to have a variety of foods from different food groups such as:  
nuts  
dairy  
protein  
fruits and vegetables  
  
You can find out more about picky plates in my Meal Planning Guide as well as on this blog here:
