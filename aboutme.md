Hi, ðŸ˜€ I am Ritobrata Ghosh.

I am an undergraduate student studying Physics, Mathematics, and CS interested in **Deep Learning** and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in **Generative Adversarial Networks**, and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. I am interested in cutting-edge research of these fields.

I am fairly active on Kaggle.

I care deeply about **solving real-world problems** with Machine Learning, and AI for good.

I enjoy reading books- fiction and non-fiction alike, listen to music, watch good TV Series, and recite poetry.
