**Research Associate** – University of Calgary, Calgary/AB, Canada May 2019 – Jan 2022

- Developed and validated a Cascade R-CNN deep learning model to detect masks and estimate respiration rate based on mask colour variation in thermal videos, achieving an accuracy of 91.95%.
- Developed and validated a synthetic dataset with thermal images, where masks are superimposed on unmasked faces. It was applied deep learning algorithms such as RetinaFace and HRNet to a large-scale multimodal dataset (>4 million images).
- Developed and validated a system for estimating respiration rate based on respiratory-related movements (chest/back) in videos in the near-infrared spectrum, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.70%. For this project, the OpenPose deep learning algorithm was used for pose estimation in addition to image processing techniques such as Lucas Kanade Optical-flow method, Butterworth filter and so on.
- Developed and validated several machine learning solutions, including CNNs, kNN, PCA, and SVM for drunkness detection on thermal face. Performed feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization on CNN using test driven development.
- Proficient with multiple Python ML solutions, libraries and frameworks including scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, Tensorflow, and Pytorch.
- Collaborated with non-technical stakeholders when developing the software solution.
- Acquire, analyzed, and transformed large, complex videos dataset.
- Supported development of object detection/segmentation (Faster R-CNN / Mask R-CNN) algorithms for PPE detection.
- Supported development of Stroke weakness classification algorithm with pressure sensors.
- Teaching assistant for Foundations of Mechatronics course for more than 60 students with hardware and software content.
- Supervised three summer students on a software/hardware project while maintaining git version control.
- Completed thesis based Masters at U of C, publishing two IEEE conference papers and one poster during my tenure.

**Between December 2016 and May 2019 I was learning English and working as a machine operator in the foam
and oil and gas pipeline construction industries.**

**Electrical Maintenance Technologist** , Petrobras, Brazil Jan 2016 – Dec 2016

- Performed corrective, preventive and predictive maintenance in Offshore Automation and
    Instrumentation Systems observing the availability of material, tools and the maintenance history through
    ERP software (SAP R/3). That included upgrading, calibration and changes to equipment such as control
    valves, transmitters, pressure switches, flow sensors, thermostats, pumps, and so on.
- Monitor and adjust equipment and process variables through the supervisory system (SCADA) and/or PLC
    programming, keeping the operation safe and environmentally correct.
- Use specific and complementary technical and operational know-how according to the relevant technical
    instructions, drawings, standards and legislation at all times with safety regulations and follow the
    business processes.

**Adjunct Professor** , Federal University of Ceara (UFC), Brazil Jan 2015 – Aug 2015

**-** Taught courses in Mathematics and Civil/Chemical/Electrical Engineering curriculums
**-** Graduate course taught: Fundamentals of Computer Programming and Programming for Engineering,
    using "C" language.
**-** Developed curriculum, teaching materials and lesson plan for the courses
**-** Supervised independent and group projects, laboratory work and hands-on training
