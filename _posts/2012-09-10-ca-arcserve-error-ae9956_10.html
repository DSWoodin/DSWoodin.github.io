V16 SP1 BUILD 6838<br/><br/>AE9956 2012-09-08 02:15:16 Initialization of the COM+ component failed! Please check setting of agent configuration.<br/><br/>Upon opening the job i was unable to expand the "Farm" node under Sharepoint databases.  This error is directly related to this issue.<br/><br/><strong>The Fix </strong> i hopped onto the Sharepoint server with the CA Sharepoint agent installed.  Opened the services console and brought up the properties.  The service was stopped and would fail to start automatically.  This service should have a service account associated under "Log On"; i reentered the credentials and the service started correctly.<br/><br/>Back on the CA ARCserve server the Farm node would now expand and jobs completes without errors.
