Starting a web-post is a daunting process. But here we go ...

There is one clear object for this webpage. To provide a location where researchers and others interested in statistics can discuss and be supported to learn statistics. BUT we all have a different way of approaching challanges so to begin the content will reflex my research and tools I am using.

I have created a simple [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/") feed for new and interesting blog posts about statistics. Information from the website will be posted there iswell. All resources are open-source. Please comment and discuss any points that don't make sense. Or even better fork the [here]("https://github.com/davan690") and add any comments via git.
