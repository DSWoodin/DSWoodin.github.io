Despite the fact that I've already completed the [Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) the previous year, took (but not completed) [Udacity's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) and have completed some data science courses online, I still felt unconfident with Python. So early this year, I decided to enroll in [edX's CS1301x: Introduction to Computing using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computing-using-python-gtx-cs1301x). Now that I've finished the course, I'm happy that I have taken it and actually felt that I should have taken it the first time I started (though that wasn't possible as it only became available early this year.) I highly recommend this course for those who want to start learning Python instead of just reading a book on it. (Reading books, however still helped me understand Python the first time.) My final score was 99% but of course, I took this online, so there's not a lot of pressure as probably taking it via a real class and you take exams. There were a lot of exercises and problems, however and passing score is 80% (once you get 80%, the certificate is available to view.)

Some of the things I learned from this course but not from Codecademy or from books such as ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart, which is one of my favorite books by the way, are classes, algorithms, recursive functions and Big O notation. There were other small bits that I can't recall as I write this but these are the big topics I can think of. 

Because of the huge amount of exercises and problems, I think it really helped me practice writing Python codes. I completed problems mostly without help, but a Slack channel for the class and a discussion group on the edX website were available for when one gets stuck. The material is a little repetitive (for enforcement) due to the additional required problems on "Smartbook", which contains the online material, only in written format. The problems on Smartbook are graded. So the program is really time-intensive. I felt like I was really taking a class. The instructor, David Joyner, was very thorough, patient, and clear! He has a knack for explaining things very well.

Although I started the program the time it started to become available in February this year, I only finished it July this year. I did stop working on it for about two months or so. So I probably spent about three to four months on it.

While I'm at it, I will mention other resources on Python that I recommend. The book, ["Python Crash Course"](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) by Eric Matthes is great also for learning Python. It is actually where I learned how to use classes. I did use the O'Reilly book, ["Learning Python"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-python-3rd/9780596513986/) by Mark Lutz but only after I have moved on past the super beginner level. I tried reading this book the time I started to learn Python and it was a little difficult to understand. That's when I tried Al Sweigart's book, ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). This book is great and helped me to get past level 0. Another thing I like about this book is the part on Regex, which I haven't really found in any other Python materials I've come across, at least not as thoroughly discussed for a beginner like me as in Sweigart's book.

From here, I plan to go back to learning [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), the Python web development framework, which I picked up after finding that I needed to learn how to make an app for a project for the Open Austin meetup group. A few weeks ago, I came across Miguel Grinberg's tutorial in [O'Reilly's Safari](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-path-introduction/9781491958018/). This will certainly be a topic in a future post.
