title: Write your first program
---

In this tutorial we focus on to write our first python program.At first open the idle or **python interpreter** then simple write the below `code` and see the magic ...

<pre>
print("Hello, World !")
</pre>
## Output :
<pre>
Hello, World !
</pre>

Find some motivation. Hope so !! There will be more magicial things out there.

Before ending this tutorial try to understand the code. So, here **print( )** is nothing but a function that we pass an argument and got the output shown above .
