<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">It’s the middle of the night and its quiet.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">My eyes are heavy and my heart feels warm. I’m drawn to my childhood which,looking back, bore a lot of good memories,numerous good memories, but I succinctly remember the carefree spirit I had as a child, the spark for life,for joy,and for meaning. I have carried that into my youth albeit with less an intensity as before. It keeps me sane,driven,in tangent with my life’s purpose. It reminds me that when the creator of the cosmos was molding the universe,he put in each being desires, big and small to create an ecosystem of love among his creatures. Those desires point us to a particular service and reminds us that life’s true purpose resides in ministry,in service to others,in whatever form. When on your knees,those desires are amplified and clearly made known to you,they are the vehicle that God will use through you to give and show love, to spread joy in this joyless world and show meaning that only comes from God himself. Heavenly desires when pursued in truth and earnest can be a tool God can use to heal the nations of the world,point to a God whose love knows no bounds,not even the bounds of death</p>
