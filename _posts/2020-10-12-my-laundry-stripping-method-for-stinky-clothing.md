With all of the buzz around the laundry stripping I did with my husband's clothes, I wanted to write out the two ingredients that I used to make the laundry stripping powder and how I went about it.  My husband's clothing was just not getting the smells out anymore. We cleaned the washer, I used hot washes, a different detergent, and nothing was helping. So I knew I had to do something heavy duty. He was skeptical until I added the clothing to the bath tub..Today on the blog, I'm sharing my laundry stripping method for stinky clothing. I was inspired by [Go Clean Go](https://www.instagram.com/gocleanco/)'s stripping method on Instagram.

**Laundry Stripping Powder Recipe**

1:1 [Nellie's detergent](https://amzn.to/370dgPu) to Sunlight Powder detergent (or any other laundry powder with enzymes, such as [Tide](https://amzn.to/2SNHexB) powder or [Gain](https://amzn.to/2GUyVh7)).

For a half a load of regular clothes (comparable to a washer half load), I used 1/2 cup of [Nellie's](https://amzn.to/370dgPu) and 1/2 cup of Sunlight. For cloth diapers, I used 1 cup:1 cup.

**How to Strip your Laundry with Laundry Stripping Powder**

_Step one_. Start with clean, dry clothes. Hold onto them until step three.

_Step two_. Turn on the tub with hot, hot water and add the stripping powder. See measurements I used above, for reference. Make sure it dissolves first before adding clothes.

_Step three_. Add clothes to the water and stir. Feast your eyes on what happens...

_Step four_. Let sit and stir every now and then for about four hours.

PS...before you're super duper shocked. We suspect his jeans made the water darker than it normally would be, but even without them, it would still be clearly gross and disgusting. I'll never not laundry strip periodically now, you know? Ew, right?!

_Step five_. Wring out clothes.

_Step six_. Do a full, normal wash, but without detergent and then dry!

Voila! No more stinky clothes. 

_PS my mail list is receiving a freebie for five other recipes and methods to try for stripping clothing. If you're not on my list, but stil would like to receive that, I'd be happy to email it to you separately for free. Just send me an email at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_

Cheers,
