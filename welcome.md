Welcome to this year's math club! This page provides a list of details and resources that will come in handy 
throughout the year.

# Getting started

Our official web site is [https://rmsmath.sharplogic.com](https://rmsmath.sharplogic.com). This site includes our coaching session schedule, 
homework assignments, competition schedule, and more. It also includes links to most of the resources listed 
here, so this should be the first place you go when looking for information. Please don't email the chair or 
coaches for something that is already published on the site.

If you're new to the math club, you should check out our [overview video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP58Q_IAsq8&ab_channel=RedmondMiddleSchoolMathClub)
that explains the overall philosophy of the club and how we work to help everyone grow.

# Email

When students are registered for math club, the student email provided and the PTSA parent email are added 
to the MathClub group in the PTSA Office 365 account. All important math club emails will be sent to that 
group by the chair account. These emails go to both parents and students. Students are ultimately responsible 
for their own participation in the math club, so the excuse "my parents didn't tell me about this" isn't 
acceptable for content covered in these emails or on the web site.  

# Coaching sessions

Coaching sessions begin the week of 10/30. They will be held 4:30-5:30PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in
the Commons. The homework assignment for each session (if assigned) is available on the schedule and will 
be updated as the year progresses. Homework assignments will be covered in sessions, so you don't need to 
submit them. While not strictly required, it is strongly recommended that everyone attempt the 
assignments to maximize the benefit of the coaching.

The value of our coaching sessions cannot be emphasized enough. The students who regularly attempt the 
homework and actively attend sessions are the ones who show the greatest growth throughout the year. 
Much of this is due to our excellent coaching staff made up of high school students who have incredibly 
strong math and communication skills. Please make the most of your access to our current coaches.

All student members are encouraged to attend all sessions. However, attendance is never required. 
There are no separate schedule invites, so it's recommended you add a recurring appointment to your calendar.

# Proctoring

We are required to have an adult proctor for each club meeting. You must have a PTSA membership and be an 
LWSD-approved volunteer, which is a simple online process that covers you for two years. See our web site 
for proctor instructions.

You can sign up for proctoring slots on the volunteer sheet. We used to ask that each member's parents 
sign up for X sessions to spread the load out, but we know from past experience that ~80% of parents 
won't sign up for anything. Our excellent coaching team has planned dozens of incredibly valuable 
sessions for this year, so if you're one of the precious few parents who wants to help out, please 
sign up to proctor as much as you can.

## What if we don't have proctor volunteers?

If the scheduled proctor does not show up to start a meeting, then that session will be cancelled. 
If you need to cancel, please find a replacement because we need to cancel the session otherwise. 
Parent emails are available in the competition sheet if you need to find a replacement.

Sessions will be cancelled in advance if we do not have proctors lined up by the previous Friday. 
We used to try to find and/or accept last-minute replacements, but I don't have the bandwidth to 
support it this year and we haven't had any volunteers for the position. If you would like to step 
up so that we can be more flexible in our proctor program, please let me know.

# Competitions

We track competitions on our competitions page and participation through the competition sheet. 
Please update the information for your status on these competitions ahead of the deadlines posted. 
If you don't see a competition listed, then it's not one we officially support. Generally speaking, 
we support major national competition series like the AMC series and Mathcounts. We also support 
regional team competitions like Math Is Cool. Everyone is encouraged to participate in whatever 
competitions they find interesting, even if participation isn't managed by the club. 
No competition is required.

# Spread the word!

We keep math club registration open for the entire year, so please forward this to anyone 
who isn't on the list that you think would want to participate.

Good luck to everyone this year!
