## The first simple planning step to take as a beginner: WRITE THINGS DOWN.

Why should we write things down? There are a lot of benefits to writing things down, but here are three of them:

* Writing things down helps commit to memory better.
* Writing things down helps us to follow through with plans better.
* Writing things down helps us to reduce our mental load.

[Here is a blog](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2018/04/15/neuroscience-explains-why-you-need-to-write-down-your-goals-if-you-actually-want-to-achieve-them/?sh=2c3ae6dc7905) on more benefits for writing things down.

If you are working on a new habit, a routine, a project, new ideas or planning a vacation..really anything that is floating around your brain: **Try writing it down.**

# Tips for the first simple planning step to take as a beginner planner:

**Commit to a time to write things down if it's for daily planning.** I tend to take five minutes every night at the end of the day. And have a notebook or digital notepad nearby to jot things down as they pop into mind. How many hours have I wasted trying to remember what I forgot to write down? It still happens sometimes and every time I remind myself that I can't not write things down.

The first simple planning step to take as a beginner planner need not be complicated. Make a commitment, stick to it, and try things out over time. And before you know it, you'll have your life a bit more organized and planned...you may even call yourself a planner by then too.
