**FURSQUARED 2023 COVID-19 POLICY**
========================================

This policy is accurate and up-to-date as of January 12, 2023. FurSquared uses the CDC recommendations as a general guide for their own COVID-19 vaccination and masking policies. We acknowledge that we are living in a fast-paced environment with ever-evolving recommendations and mitigations. We therefore commit that we will announce and publish final updates to this policy (if any) no later than May 7, 2023.

FurSquared 2023 will take place amid a continuing global pandemic. While attendees, staff and our guests must understand holding an event entirely free of COVID-19 risk is impossible in the current environment, the convention will take every reasonable measure to minimize such risks. To this end, the following COVID-19 Policy applies to the 2023 event.

**The Short Version:**

- COVID-19 primary vaccination and booster shots recommended (even if not mandatory) by your home country's vaccination guidelines (check the [CDC Immunization Schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf) for US residents) are required to attend the FurSquared 2023.

- Booster shots can be either the older, monovalent form or the newer, bivalent type.

- Paper records (ex: vaccine card or vaccination records) or digital copies (ex: photo, PDF, or digital app) will be accepted as proof of vaccination. We do not recommend only having a QR code as QR code readers may not be available.

- Masks compliant with [CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) are required in all public spaces of the convention. This includes under fursuit heads.

**The Long Version:**

**VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS**
----------------------------

*(Update October 2, 2023: Clarification of vaccination and booster deadlines.)*

**The requirements apply to all staff and attendees regardless of age.** You must provide proof that all of your COVID-19 vaccinations are up to date and have received all shots in the primary series and any boosters recommended to you by your home country's vaccination guidelines.

The following table applies to US residents (using the CDC recommendations as a guide) and presents the deadlines for the vaccination requirements in different groups (all dates refer to the 2023 calendar year):

| AGE | PRIMARY VACCINE | REQUIREMENTS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **6 months - 11 years** | Moderna | All two doses by Nov. 17 |
| **6 months - 4 years** | Pfizer-BioNTech | All three doses by Nov. 17 |
| **5 - 11 years** | Pfizer-BioNTech | One Pfizer booster (3rd dose) by time of attendance unless the last dose of the primary series was given between July 1 - Nov. 17 |
| **12 - 17 years** | Pfizer-BioNTech  | | Moderna Novavax | One Pfizer booster (3rd dose) by time of attendance unless the last dose of the primary series was given between Oct. 1 - Nov. 17 |
| **18+ years** | Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna Novavax J&J's Janssen | One booster by time of attendance unless last dose of the primary series: | 2nd shot for Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax,Â *or* 1st shot for J&J was given between Oct. 1 - Nov. 17 |

FurSquared does recommend (but not require) anyone over 50 years old or immunocompromised receive a second booster before attending the FurSquared 2023 (see CDC for guidelines)

The booster shot can be either the older, monovalent form or the newer, bivalent type.

### NON-US RESIDENTS

Please check your home country's COVID-19 vaccination guidelines to determine what vaccines and boosters are recommended. The FurSquared will then require those recommendations for attendance to the convention. For example: For Canadians aged 18 years or older, Health Canada recommends at least one booster shot. Therefore, any Canadian attendees aged 18 years or older will need a booster to attend the convention.

### ACCEPTABLE PROOF INCLUDES

- An original vaccination card provided by the CDC or your home country, *or*

- A paper or digital report from a state sponsored organization, *or*

- Records from vaccination apps on mobile devices (MyChart, Docket, etc.)

- A formal letter from a doctor that shows compliance with the tables above

Photos of the above documents clearly showing the name and date of the shot(s) may be accepted at the sole discretion of the convention.

All documentation must be accompanied by a photo ID with a name that matches the name on the documentation.

The requirements above apply to all staff and attendees regardless of age. Documentation must be checked and confirmed by convention representatives prior to entering Convention Registration.

MASK REQUIREMENTS
-----------------

All attendees and staff are required to properly wear a [CDC-approved](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) face mask in public spaces of the convention. Note that bandanas and gaiters are not considered adequate face coverings. It is acceptable to remove your mask for short periods to eat or get a drink of water. CDC-approved masks or balaclavas are required in the Fursuit Lounges as well, even when fursuit heads are removed.

If you have asthma or a related medical condition you can remove your mask if you have a medical episode. Once the episode is finished we ask you to wear the mask again. Feel free to reach out to a staffer if you need assistance.

More details on proper masks and mask wearing can be found in the following link: [CDC Guidelines for mask usage.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)

***Please note:* **Woodwind, brass, and other breath powered instruments may not be played in any convention space (other than as a scheduled performance), as masking such instruments is impractical.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
--------------------------

### VACCINATIONS

- What if I am unable to get fully vaccinated before November 17th, 2023?

If you are unable or unwilling to get vaccinated and provide proof of vaccination, we encourage you to consider attending FurSquared 2023 as we will be unable to admit you this year.

- What about mixing the primary series and booster vaccines from different manufacturers?

Per the CDC:

***Primary series***

*CDC does not recommend mixing products for your primary series doses. If you received Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax COVID-19 for the first dose of your primary series, you should get the same product for all following primary series doses.*

***Boosters***

*People ages 18 years and older may get a different product for a booster than they got for their primary series as long as it's Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or in some cases J&J/Janssen. Children and teens ages 5 through 17 years who got a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series must also get Pfizer-BioNTech for a booster.*

*Novavax is not authorized for use as a booster dose at this time.*

- I am from outside the United States, how can I be sure I met all vaccination requirements?

According to the CDC, any non-US residents must complete the primary vaccination series and any boosters recommended by their country of residence. Please check your country's own vaccination guidelines for more details.

- How will MFF be verifying vaccination proof from attendees?

FurSquared representatives will verify each attendee's proof of vaccination before they will be admitted into the registration hall.

- How will proof of vaccination be kept confidential?

Proof of vaccination will be handled separate from event registration. No information will be retained, nor will it be shared with convention volunteers.

- What if somebody fakes their proof of vaccination?

Any FurSquared attendee reasonably believed to have forged vaccine status credentials will be ejected from the event and will have their membership privileges revoked for all future FurSquared events.

- I'm not fully vaccinated; can I attend if I have a negative COVID-19 test?

No; vaccination is required as described above.

### MASKS

- What types of masks will be required?

Acceptable masks consist of:

- An N95, KN95, surgical, or other commercially-produced medical mask

- A cloth mask made of **two or more layers** of tight knit fabric.

All masks must:

- Cover the wearer's nostrils and mouth snugly without excessive gaps

- Remain fastened in place without the use of hands or other external measures other than ear loops, Velcro, loop extenders, or buttons, etc.

We recommend following [the CDC's guidance for mask usage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) to see if your mask or balaclava satisfies those requirements

- Do I have to wear a mask under my fursuit head?

Yes, attendees must wear masks underneath fursuit heads or other costume pieces.

- What happens if someone refuses to wear a mask?

Refusal to comply with the masking requirement within public spaces may result in revocation of FurSquared membership for 2023, with consideration given to revocation of membership for future FurSquared events.

- Is there a masking exception for performers on stage?

Yes, depending on the event and room configuration. Specific masking requirements will be made available for those participating on stage as we approach the convention. Attendees should expect circumstances where people on stage are not masked.

### THE EVENT

- Is it safe to attend conventions already?

This is a personal question you must ask yourself. We are following all suggested medical guidelines to provide the safest event we can. We encourage attendees to stay aware of current local infection rates and risks for our event via [the Illinois Department of Health portal](https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/data.html).

- Can you guarantee I won't catch Covid?

No. There is an inherent risk in travel as well as any large gatherings. While vaccines and indoor masking are effective at reducing the risk of infection and serious illness, there is still some risk of infection. Decide for yourself if you are comfortable with this risk.

- Is my registration refundable?

We know that illness can strike right before you are set to travel. It is always best to stay home if you start to feel sick. We want to make this decision easier for you by amending our refund policy: Purchased registrations may be refunded or transferred to another person of your choosing. If you choose to transfer your registration to another person, the deadline for this is November 22, 2023. After that time we are happy to issue a refund for any unused registration through December 10, 2023.

Refunds and transfers can only be requested by the person that purchased the badge and refunds are issued to the credit card used for the initial purchase. Please email your refund or transfer request (along with the name and email address of the person you are wanting to transfer your registration to, if you are wanting to do a transfer) to <registration@furfest.org>.

- Are convention rooms refundable?

All FurSquared partner hotels allow for cancellation of rooms with no penalty in accordance with each hotel's policies up until the hotel's cancellation deadline. Deadlines vary by hotel from seven days to 48 hours prior to check-in; see your booking confirmation for details. Booking fees are not refundable.

- What about Monkeypox?

As of the initial publication of this policy, knowledge and recommendations regarding the 2023 Monkeypox outbreak are still evolving. We do know that Monkeypox is spreading in the United States. You can protect yourself and other event goers by learning about monkeypox before coming to FurSquared. [Find out more about monkeypox here.](http://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/index.html) If there are any updates from the CDC or other health authorities, we will include all relevant recommendations and mitigations in the final version of this policy.
