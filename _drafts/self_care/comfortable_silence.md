 Me too. And my wife, too. It’s perfect. We were both married to very emotionally needy people previously. Very unhealthy and codependent. It’s not that we don’t connect or have intimacy. We just don’t need to talk about every goddamn thing or emotion or issue going on in our lives. No need to constantly reassure, compliment or otherwise provide a crutch just so the other can adult properly. We handle our own shit, talk it out if it’s a financial or other issue that affects us both. We’re just good at balancing healthy communication with comfortable silence.
