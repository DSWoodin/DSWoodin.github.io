Work/life balance - if you’re single and don’t have kids, unfortunately many companies assume that you’ll make them number one. Aside from leaving on time and taking your breaks because you’re entitled to them, create actual activities that are long term commitments. These can be real or fake, real is better of course, but the fake ones will bolster the boundary you’re setting.

A spin class, a night course, a book club, a physiotherapist appointment, etc. Anything like weekly drinks with old coworkers downtown or ‘I want to go home and relax’, won’t hold as much weight. Use educational/health related activities. If you have kids and/or a spouse, even better.

You can also phrase it as ‘I don’t have any long standing commitments Tuesday/Thursday after hours each week and am more flexible then’.
