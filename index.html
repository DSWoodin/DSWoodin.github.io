I am currently a student at the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I am dual-enrolled as an undergraduate 
senior and first year master's student.  I am also candidate in the Robotics Master's Program, with a focus in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.  
For my undergraduate degree, I study Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.  I have 
gained a strong background in these fields throughout my undergraduate studies, while also discovering that research is the perfect outlet for me 
to apply my knowledge and skills.  Recently, both my research and academics have been focused on Computer Vision.  See my <a href="https://geande.github.io/coursework/">coursework</a>
and <a href="https://geande.github.io/projects/">projects</a> sections for more details!

<br>
Robotics and AI are my passions, and hopefully this website provides a platform for me to demonstrate some of my projects, as well as my interests.
