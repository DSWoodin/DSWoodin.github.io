The astrophysics center of Wuhan University is a scientific research institution affiliated to the School of Physics and Technology of Wuhan University. Wuhan University is a famous university in China, which had no astronomy major until 2017. At the beginning of 2017, Professor Zonghong Zhu and Professor Wei Wang were transferred to Wuhan University to officially establish the astronomy group in the School of Physics and Technology.

The leaders of Wuhan University and the School of Physics of Wuhan University value greatly the development of astronomy, so our research team is constantly developing and expanding. 

At present, there are 7 researchers in the center, including 3 professors, one associate professor, 3 researchers, 8 postdoctors, and several doctoral students. 

The research advantages and interests of astronomy in Wuhan University are mainly concentrated in cosmology, gravitational wave astronomy, high-energy astrophysics, multi-band observation and research of transient sources, and electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves.
