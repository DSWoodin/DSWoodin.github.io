# Bandit2 - 3


### Password: aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG


## Problem


**Bandit Level 2 - Level 3**


**Level Goal**


The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory



## Solving


1. **Check which files are located**


  - I checked out files located in home directory

  ![Read File Contents](/assets/img/bandit2-3/Screenshot%202024-02-14%20at%2009.22.34.png)


2. **Read the file**

   - CLI(command-line interface) interprets each work separated by a space as different argument, leading to errors because it does not recognize the intended file.

   - For example, If I have a file name `My Document.txt` and I attempt to read it with command line without quotes

   `cat My Document.txt`

   - CLI interprets `My` as the filename and `Document.txt` as another command or argument, resulting in an error.

   - By enclosing the filenmae in quotes, CLI treats `My Document.txt` as a single argument, allowing the command to execute and read the file

   `cat 'My Document.txt'`
