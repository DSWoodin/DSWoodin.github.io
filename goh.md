**RHUBARB the BEAR**, in his human form, is a freelance composer, music director, jingle producer, studio musician, and multi-instrumentalist. He serves as an arranger/orchestrator for The Haygoods and Cassandre: Voice Of An Angel (both in Branson, MO), the Jazzaar Festival of Aarau, Switzerland; and the international Circus Vargas, and his music has been heard as far away as Disney Tokyo.  He also plays whatever instrument is most needed in any given show at the Winter Park Playhouse in Orlando, FL, where his husband Cosmik is Music Director.

In 2010 his stage musical Julie Bunny Must Die appeared at the Orlando International Fringe Festival; to his knowledge it was the first time a mainstream musical featured a character (“LaserWolf”) who was a member of the furry fandom. He then attended his first con (MFF 2010) to see how accurate his portrayal was. Within two years Julie Bunny would be performed at Wild Nights, Oklacon, and Megaplex; the following year Megaplex also hosted his hit Fringe musical Fosgate: Ferret Loan Officer, an anthropomorphic spoof of Shakespeare’s The Merchant Of Venice. Currently he is carefully finishing up his rock opera Ony, The Runaway Circus Bear, which has already been performed live at Mephit Fur Meet, Eurofurence, and Nordic Fuzz Con, despite Rhubarb’s initial plan to make a recording and leave it at that.
