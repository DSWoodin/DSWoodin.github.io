## Abstract
Using the coherent WaveBurst pipeline, 
we developed a pipeline with novel extension, referred to as the Stokes Circular Polarisation algorithm, 
for the search of burst gravitational waves signals in KAGRA.
The algorithm can be used to estimate the Stocks parameters, especially the V mode (circular polarisation), 
of gravitational waves detected using the coherent WaveBurst pipeline.
By applying the developed algorithm and a simulated core collapse supernova waveform, referred to as SFHx, 
we estimated the detectability of the V mode of SFHx with a network of advanced LIGO, 
advanced VIRGO and KAGRA, for sources across the sky at three different distances, 2kpc, 5kpc and 10kpc. 
We found that the detectability of the V mode is consistent with the recoverability of the two polarisations of 
gravitational waves (h+ and hx) with respect to the network, and the overall detector response to the signal.
