#### Think outside of your box/bubble

People inevitably go into the experience of working on a long term design project with various preconceptions of what they want to make and why, especially if the project is one that involves considerable creativity with team members developing a sense of a personal or emotional stake in the functionality and success of the design. I am no exception – going into the early stages of planning a design project to promote user engagement at the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), I had various disjoint yet specific visions for what my design could be. These ideas proved stubborn to disregard – I found myself leaning towards ideas that drew from my own experiences in museums and continually suggesting things to my group members that pushed our brainstorming in the direction of my own experience, without paying much attention to our need to broaden the scope of personas that might use our design. This is a slippery slope and an especially dangerous one to find yourself on in the early stages of the design process (read more about questioning assumptions [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-be-creative.html)). 

My experience with creative projects usually involved coming up with an idea and then building it while making adjustments along the way – the notions of coming up with ideas iteratively and using feedback directly from my target user base to adjust my brainstorming were unfamiliar and felt almost unnatural to me. However, this process of actively seeking out information from people with different perspectives than myself and incorporating this wider reservoir of experience into my brainstorming process proved to be the most illuminating step of my design process. 

### Iterate, iterate, then iterate more!

A designer can have access to all kinds of useful information, they can even take the time to seek out such information, but if they are so attached to their original preconceptions of their design that they are unwilling to take new, potentially conflicting data into account then all of their efforts will have been for naught. It is always necessary to change one’s approach the moment new data contradicts previous assumptions. For that crucial reason and many others, it is necessary to iterate continuously throughout the design process and to think critically about how each iteration can improve on the last.

To further illustrate the power of iterative designing, consider the example of my project SWCMA and how my team and I were able to successfully streamline the design into a more usable result by repeatedly rethinking and redesigning our product based on input from participants in contextual inquiries and usability tests. More specifically, in our final usability test (read more [here](https://cmpelz.github.io/2018-11-18-user_experience_design_overview/)), we discovered that each of our three diverse users (one college student with an interest in art, one without, and a community member who does not attend the school but likes art) did not understand what our product was meant to do and found that our functions did not connect to our tasks in the way that we had hoped. This helped us step away from our design, an app meant to improve visitors’ agency when navigating gallery halls and encourage them to save and share pieces that they connect with, and notice that we had combined cumbersome hardware with too many confusing menus that did too many things. Negative reactions from participants in our usability tests helped us notice something that we were too close to the product to see ourselves: we had unintentionally obfuscated the core purposes of our product such that users did not know what to do with our app. We immediately knew what had to be done: strip away the unnecessary hardware and menus and build an app that focuses directly on our tasks. We were able to arrive at this decision not only because of our willingness to listen to outsiders but also because we took the time to reimagine our product from different angles and adjust its design accordingly. 

### Work to make things accessible every step of the way

When working through the design process, it is easy to think that simply iterating repeatedly while simultaneously gathering amazing data from participants, contextual inquiries, usability testing, or other techniques for user experience research is enough to generate a perfect product. Having this mindset and utilizing these tools is just the first step to designing a product that people will enjoy using – it is also necessary to build accessibility into your design at every step of the way. 

Part of this is inherent to thinking outside of the box and working iteratively: I was continually impressed by the participants in my user experience research in their ability to point out ways in which my design might be confusing or present a barrier to use for people with limited technology experience or those unfamiliar with navigating WCMA’s unique space. However, while considering different levels of experience and knowledge among users is a crucial part of making a product accessible, it is still just one part.

While working on developing a more advanced prototype of our design, my group also read about different cases of well-designed, accessible products for user bases with specific needs (read more about some of the populations of users with specific design needs [here](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)). We elected to use the [POUR methodology]( https://theblog.adobe.com/design-with-accessibility-in-mind-the-pour-methodology/) as we continued our design process, especially focusing on making the information in our product easily perceivable and understandable. We found that issues of operability, such as confusing back buttons, were often discussed at length by our users (read more [here]( https://cmpelz.github.io/2018-11-8-usability_review/)) and also felt that the issue of robustness was more relevant to implementation. Thinking at length about making our product as perceivable and operable as possible helped us greatly streamline our design and, in addition to making the product feel more elegant, forced us to narrow down the tasks we support. This ultimately forced us to think more critically about what we wanted our product to do with the result being a much deeper understanding of our vision for all three of us.

### Don't be afraid to steal: many of the most important ideas come from outside your own head

Looking back on the early stages of our design process with the perspective gained from contextual inquiries, usability testing, and extensive reading about accessible design (among many other topics), it is now clear to me that my priorities early on were not consistent with the needs of users. I wanted to come up with something fun and revolutionary – something uniquely mine where my creative spark would be immediately visible, something that would absolutely revolutionize the museum experience of WCMA visitors. I thought I could know what my users want without directly asking them and that if I was creative enough I would come up with a perfect idea on the first try – at the root of these misconceptions was my desire to come up with something that was completely my own. I was completely off base for two main reasons: 1) I overestimated my knowledge of my user base while simultaneously underestimating their intuition of how to use my product (addressed mainly in the first two sections of this manifesto) and 2) I thought, for some reason, that I had to reinvent the wheel with my design.
To elaborate on this second point, consider these two sections on design principles related to color and grid layouts: [this one]( https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F133121208%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGp9DlcbQs0LoE4EELxHN16P0HKWw), which describes different design conventions for accessible, usable color schemes and layouts on small screens, and [this one]( https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F133121202%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFnAftFSUGrK3_ujx6CwIEO4KpCew), which describes design principles and conventions for making accessible, usable grids. These are just two examples of countless existing sources that compile years of user experience research and iterative design – the result is concise and immediately applicable design knowledge. There is no reason to try to make these kinds of things up on your own, or worse, to attempt to revolutionize these heavily studied fields without any evidence to back up your theories. These sources, among many others, were invaluable as my team and I grappled with these lofty goals of accessible, conscientious, usable design – they meant that we did not need to waste time on nitty gritty details that have already been ironed out by the best designers among our predecessors and could instead simply incorporate these existing ideas into our design.
Throughout the design process, much of the ideas that shape a product come not from the designers themselves but rather from participants in usability tests or from influential designers who discovered the best ways to make certain aspects of design accessible and pleasant to use. Yes, a designer’s job is to be creative, but, perhaps more importantly, a designer must incorporate dozens (or maybe hundreds) of disparate ideas into a cohesive design. These ideas can come from all kinds of places – a good designer knows how to recognize when they cannot improve on something and will be humble enough to use the best elements of that something for their product.
