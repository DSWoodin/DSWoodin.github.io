My first post is about my experience learning Jekyll and Markdown.   I started this expedition by
wanting to create a company website.  I did not initially intend to have a blog, I wanted to expand my 
knowledge of git and saw an article to create a website using Git Pages and Cloudflare.  Now I am a convert.
What a great idea.  Other than purchasing a domain at an annual fee of $20, the website is up and runnning
with no other incurred costs, only my time.  

I tried this sample and choose a theme which creates a simple page with no header and footer and then started to add features to it, like a nice header, footer and formatting.    I finally decided that was going to tak
beautiful-jekyll and start from a template that had a lot of the features already built in.

Pagination.  This one still gets me.  Why does a page with pagination have to be called index.html. I did not really
want pagingations for my posts but what I did want was to be able to filter posts.  Finally figured out how to do that.

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I had a hard time with this. I know quite a bit of HTML but just could not wrap my head around markdown language and some of the rules.   I encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

At some point you will need to learn Bootstrap CSS framework.  I wanted to have three columns on the front page and needed to understand how to do that.  This also came into play on the contact form formatting.  Markdown is ok for simple pages and text but does not really do a good job of offering solutions for nice formatting.

Then of course I wanted to have a contact form.  This is really easy in Wordpress, but alas there is no CMS here. Fortunately there are solutions that offer you to link to a services.  I chose one from http://formspree.io/
