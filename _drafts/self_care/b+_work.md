 My therapist says I need to work on doing “B+ work.”

She says people shouldn’t give up all expectations and start doing shitty work.... but trying to make every single thing an A+ project is crippling and will never be successful.

The student who can turn in B+ work every week is way way way way better than the student who turns in one A+ project and doesn’t turn in anything else.
