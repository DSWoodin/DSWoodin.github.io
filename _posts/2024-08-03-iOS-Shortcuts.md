### Pomodoro Timer

#### Overview

The Pomodoro technique is a time management system that involves breaking down work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the Italian word for tomato, as the inventor, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to time his work intervals.

Using a Pomodoro timer helps you focus on manageable segments of work, reducing the need to constantly check the clock or get distracted by other tasks. This technique can improve your productivity, help you prioritize work, and reduce stress by ensuring regular breaks.

#### How to Use

1. Open the Shortcuts app on your macOS device.
2. Find and run the "Pomodoro Timer" shortcut.
3. The shortcut will automatically follow a 25-minute focus session and a 5-minute break.
4. Tap "OK" to begin a work session.
5. Focus on your work during the work session.
6. When the timer completes, take a short break.
7. Repeat the process as needed to manage your work time effectively.
