Chise is a Senior Scientist in Vaccine Research and Development and has been in the field for a little over 10 years.

Her research focuses on uncovering mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, host immunity, and to better understand basic aspects of viral pathogenesis to apply that knowledge toward development of safer and more effective vaccines.

Currently, her research efforts have been dedicated to SARS-CoV-2 as she helped develop and provide research for Moderna’s vaccine that was co-developed with NIAID. She recently received the 2022 National Institutes of Health Director’s Award as a member of the Vaccine Research Center Omicron Response Team.

Outside of the pandemic, her research efforts have been dedicated to developing vaccines against Cancer, HIV, Influenza, RSV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Zika, Ebola, DENV, and other emerging pathogens.

When she is not at work and conducting research, Chise utilizes her fursona and her platform to provide science communication on Twitter to help aid people’s understanding of COVID-19 and vaccines in general.

As a member of both communities, she also utilizes her platform as an activist for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ members in the fandom.

Meet Keyotter and Rhubarb - furry musicians known for their covers of video game music\! Key, the otter/yoshi, is a pianist, accordionist, and music teacher. Rhubarb is a Nidorino and a jazz violinist. The two of them have been playing music with each other for their entire lives - because they are twin brothers\! Originally from Urbana, IL, they grew up together with a love of music, video games, and nerd culture - the perfect ingredients for becoming video game music enthusiasts (and furries\!). Now they combine those passions by bringing concerts and jam sessions to furry conventions.

Key got his start peforming for the fandom with a live streamed set at virtual FurSquared in 2021. When cons opened back up, Key teamed up with Rhubarb to form Otter Chaos\!, a collective of furry performers and arrangers of video game music. Both as a duo and as part of Otter Chaos\!, Key and Rhubarb have traveled the Midwest, bringing energetic live performances to cons such as Midwest FurFest, Indy Fur Con, Anthrocon, and of course, FurSquared. They are excited and honored to bring their unique musical flair to FurSquared 2023\!
