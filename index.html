<h2>Statistical Ecology</h2>

  <p>These are the resources I often talk about and personally use regularly. I have only added my brief notes and am no way affiliated or represent any of the resources below. I haven't meet many of these researchers and developers but hopefully one day. Most of the resources are open-source and are forked to my personal <a href="https://github.com/davan690/" target="_blank">github account</a>.
</p>

<p><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/" target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a> This is an open source community that teaches R and other data tools. They also run workshops and classes at many Australian Universities. IN there words: "Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full life cycle of data-driven research." </p>

<p><a href = "https://colbyecology.github.io/"> A mathematical ecology course</a> This course I have not done but I think it looks pretty kol. Let me know if anyone does it.</p>

<a href = https://github.com/davan690>The Statistics Network </a>My personal list of resources but in particular look at the `usefulr` repository.

<p>I am updating this as and when I find new resources. Mostly, this list is to support my own development and to remind myself how to do many of these R and Markdown tricks and tips I find on the web. </p>

<p><a href="http://stat545.com/Classroom/" >STAT545</a>
  This is an amazing graduate course from the University of British Columbia. I will often return to this course to check code and explanations I need.
</p>

<a href="https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/r-more/topics/tidyverse.html" > Monash help</a>

This is a simple html page similar to this with information for Monash bio-informatics platform.

<p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" > Cheat-sheets</a> These are really important and RStudio do many good ones. There are many other variations out there though.

  <h2> Data Science</h2>

<p>These resources are very helpful but take a slightly different approach to ecological studies however the pay is much better as a "data scientist (DS)" in the current job  <a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com/"> market </a>
  
<p>The DS community is great and even have there own slack channel. I still haven't found a great resource for this but here are a few general videos to start here:   
     
   <dl><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQ61RZKzwE" >a basic overview</a> but has a boring intro </dl>
   <dl>or</dl>
   <dl><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNV9EqwXCpw" > microsoft</a> video here but its pretty dry.

<p>A very limited list of genetics options. I am no way an expert with these packages or analyses.</p>

<h2>Reproduciblity</h2>

The science article here

<p><a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BES-Reproducible-Code.pdf" >BES Code Guidelines</a> I am working on several areas of this currently and will extend this into a separate section in the near future hopefully.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science" >Open Science Framework</a> A key organisation and resource for the development of reproducible research.</p>

<h2>Invasive species</h2>

<p>Here is the development of my PhD work in more detail for my supervisors and colleagues.
</p>

<h4> New Zealand Beech forest dynamics</h4>

<p>
  This publication clarifies the discrepancy between; two modelling papers that suggest mesopredator release of rodents is possible in New Zealand forest systems and; several field studies that have presented limited but conflicting support for increases in mouse abundance following predator control. We used an experimental design to test the differences between the two "frames of though" and found that there is no evidence to suggest mice will become more abundant after predator removal ([*additional resources can be found here*](https://davan690.github.io/)).
</p>

<h4> New Zealand mixed-forest dynamics</h4>

<h4> Population dynamics</h4>


<h4>Resources</h4>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/davan690/PestManagement/blob/master/README.md">Individual based pest modelling</a> This is a `repo` from a recent publication on dynamic pest management from Dean Anderson and others.</p>

<h4>Feedback and comments</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BES-Reproducible-Code.pdf">Draft for comments</a> Here is the first chapter draft finally. Feel free to add comments in <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BES-Reproducible-Code.pdf">word</a> or <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BES-Reproducible-Code.pdf">pdf</a></p> format and send through to `anthony.davidson@canberra.edu.au`</p>
