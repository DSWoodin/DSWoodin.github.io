Hi! This is my professional home page. 

I'm currently a student in computer science at Northwestern University. I've worked on various software development projects and started DealDock, a solution to inefficient deal management in private equity through the use of AI.

In the summer of 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern at Drishti, an AI startup that uses computer vision to assist manufacturing firms in optimizing their workflow. I helped build out a customer facing portal that would allow individual customers to monitor analytics and camera insights for each of their factory lines. 

I'm excited to share some of my musings across various topics and different projects in my blog, and I hope you find them insightful. 

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free email me at *nirmalb@u.northwestern.edu*
