 How men insult women by how they define them, and why. 
 
 1. We will leave you alone and childless.
 
 You’re only value is being a mother having a man’s child. It's every woman’s dream to give up her life to raise some scrotes kid, we will deprive you of that.
 
 You don't have a man leaching off your energy and impregnating you with his spawn? YOU MUST BE MISERABLE! :D
 
 2. You’re fat.
 
 Your value is being attractive to a man, to get a man, and be his brood mare.
 
 In order for a man to even be interested in you have to work bitch. Don’t you want be the best sex object you can be?
 
 3. You’re a bitch. (also Karen).
 
 You’re supposed to be agreeable and never argue with a man. Even if it is about something like having basic human rights.
 
 Be seen, not heard. Stop being passionate about something if we don't agree with it. It isn't attractive.
 
 4. You're such a nerd/poser
 
 Women shouldn't try to be funny, it's weird and makes us uncomfortable. Just laugh at our stupid attempts at jokes.
 
 You're not supposed to have a successful career in a "male field". When you do we will bully and harass you out.
 
 6. You're crazy.
 
 I lied to you and manipulated you and now you are rightfully pissed at me, which makes you totally CRAZY!
 
 You shouldn't be able to see through my gaslighting, but you did. If you stayed ignorant you wouldn't be mad/crazy so whose fault is that? It's your fault for being with me in the first place.
 
 7. You're being manipulative
 
 You're expressing how I've hurt you and it's making me feel bad. You're only doing this because you have an agenda, which is you wanting to make me feel bad.
 
 That's the only sole single reason.
 
 8. You’re a prude. Cold Fish. Ice Queen.
 
 I wanted to do something sexually that you don’t like/don’t want to try and when you set that boundary it made me angry.
 
 What do you mean NO? That is not normal female behavior.... At least that is not what I have learned by watching porn.
 
 9. You have no chill, I thought you were cool, Relax.
 
 Why won't you let me trample all over your boundaries and take advantage of you?
 
 Don't you want me to like you? You are supposed to earn my approval since I am such a prize, dance, monkey, DANCE!
