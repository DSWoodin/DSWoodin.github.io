Standardizing data vectors is an important step in data science. For example, different data sources often represent the same entity, such as country names, in different ways or with different spellings. In addition, small errors or formatting inconsistencies can complicate joins and lead to difficulties in downstream analysis. While excellent resources do exist to solve this problem for individual use cases, such as the [countries](https://github.com/fbellelli/countries) package in R, it can be useful to understand general methods to self-standardize categorical vectors. There are three approaches that I've used to standardize character vectors. I've written scripts below to illustrate each method.

## The vector to standardize

```{r, echo = F}
disease_data <- tribble(
  ~disease_name,            ~outbreaks,
  "Influenza",              15,
  "Inflenza",               10,
  "COVID-19",               95,
  "sars-covid-19",          90,
  "Malaria",                20,
  "Maleria",                22,
  "malaria",                20,
  "Diabetes",               30,
  "Diabetis",               28,
  "HIV/AIDS",               75,
  "HIV",                    70,
  "AIDS",                   65,
  "Tuberculosis",           40,
  "Tuberclosis",            38,
  "Alzheimers",             23,
  "Alzheimers Disease",     27,
  "Heart Disease",          60,
  "Heart Diease",           58,
)
knitr::kable(disease_data)
```

1. Standardization by string distance
2. Clustering
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
