# Bandit0 - 1


### Password: NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL


## Things to Know


1. **What is SSH**

   SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that provides users with a secure way to access web and other kinds of servers remotely. SSH is "secure" because it incorporates **encryption** and **authentication** through a process called public key cryptography. Public key cryptography is a method to encrypt or sign data with two different keys. One of the keys, the public key, is available for anyone to use. The other key, the private key, is kept secret by its owner. Because the two keys correspond to each other, establishing the key owner's identity requires possession of the private key that matches the public key.

2. **When to Use SSH**

   This protocol is used for:

   - Providing secure access for users and automated processes.
   - Interactive and automated file transfers.
   - Issuing remote commands.
   - Managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.


## Problem


**Bandit Level 0 - Level 1**


**Level Goal**


The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.


The username is `bandit0` and the password is `bandit0`.


## Solving


1. **Login to the Remote SSH Server of Bandit**


   - Open a terminal and enter the following command:
     - `ssh username@hostname -p portnumber`

   - Enter the password for bandit0.
     - The password for bandit0 is **bandit0**.

2. **Find the Password and Read the File**

   - It is located in the `readme` file in the home directory.

   - `ls` displays the contents of the current directory.
   
   - `cat` displays the contents of a file.
