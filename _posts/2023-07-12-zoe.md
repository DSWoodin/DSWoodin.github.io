I've been looking after animals for years, mostly for long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.

#### Pet Sitting
My husband Bill and I can look after your pets in your home. We mainly sit dogs but in the past we've cared for several generations of customers' cats and even birds.

Before starting a sit we'll visit to get to know your pet and, in the case of dogs, join you on  a walk.

We don't take pets into our own home and we're not dog walkers.

 - We charge £35 per day or part of day:
 - A non-returnable £35 deposit secures a booking.
 - We'll sleep overnight in your house.
 - At least one of us will stay with your pet through most of each day
 - Dogs get walked up to twice a day.
 - We'll bring our own food and bedding.
 - We'll leave your house in good order.

We can only sit one house at a time and may be continuously booked so please contact me well in advance.

#### Domestic cleaning
I can clean your house regularly or as a one-off. My husband, Bill, often assists me but I am happy to clean by myself.

We're'e discreet and we take our customers' privacy seriously.
