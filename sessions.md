subtitle: Weekly practice sessions at RMS

Math club members are expected to regularly attend our weekly practice sessions on Fridays from 2:50-4:00 in Red Cedar pod.

# Varsity #
The Varsity room is for members of our Varsity group, which is an earn-in group formed within the math club.
Membership qualification is objective and based purely on performance in math competitions.
The focus of this group is to provide in-depth training on advanced topics for the students who have proven 
results in middle school math competitions. Every sanctioned competition will provide an opportunity for any 
student to earn their way into the group moving forward. Once in the group, weekly homework and attendance is
mandatory, and those who do not participate are at risk of relegation. 

## Varsity Qualifiers ##
- Top 10 in the RMS Math Club Benchmark or Final exams
- Honor Roll of Distinction (top 1%) of the AMC 8
- Making the RMS Mathcounts team (top 10 in school round)
- Making an RMS Math is Cool Masters team (top 4 from RMS grade in Math is Cool regional)
- Individual placement (trophy-level) in sanctioned events like Math is Cool, Knights of Pi, or the Washington State Math Championships

# Club Room #
Non-Varsity students will be split each week based on their homework performance for the weekly topic.
Those who have completed the homework and demonstrated a mastery of the subject will join the Club room
for more advanced training on that topic. The focus of the Club room is to prepare students to tackle
challenging competition problems. Please remind your student that homework completion is mandatory to
attend the Club room, so they need to bring it with them each week.

# Homework Room #
Those who did not complete the homework—or those who need help with the topic—will attend the Homework room.
The focus of the Homework room is to help the students build a better foundation in that week’s topic so they
can feel more confident in tackling future homework assignments. The coach will work through each of the
homework questions and cover additional enrichment as time permits.

# Competitions & Teams #
All students are encouraged—but not required—to participate in all eligible competitions.
Parents are responsible for forming teams, which may draw from both the Varsity and Club members.
Signup spreadsheets will be provided to help parents in forming teams on a per-competition basis.

# Parent Proctors #
We are required to staff each room with a parent proctor for the duration of each math club meeting.
You will need to be physically in the room from 2:50-4:00 but will not be required to participate in 
the class beyond keeping student respectful of their environment. After the session, you will need to 
turn the lights off and lock the doors. Please add yourself to the signup sheet for primary and backup 
proctor volunteers. It’s the responsibility of any given week’s primary to make sure the backup will 
take their place if they can’t make it. You will also need to be an LWSD approved volunteer
(https://www.lwsd.org/get-involved/volunteering-in-lwsd).
