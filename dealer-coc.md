# Dealer Code of Conduct

Your merchandise must be acceptable under any and all applicable rules or laws.  Adult material outside the Mature Dealer Section must be kept away from minors.; binders must be closed when not being browsed or kept under/behind the table.  Displays must not encroach on other dealerships.  Annoyances such as lights, music or sound, and strong smells or fumes must be kept under your control.  Larger powered equipment must be approved by FurSquared and the convention center in advance.

Items and services that are illegal to possess or sell in the state of Wisconsin are equally prohibited in the Dealers den.

Items of a racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful nature will not be permitted for sale in the Dealers Room.  This includes paraphernalia related to certain groups or political movements, or items intended to agitate and provoke.

No Ai/nft artwork.

As DD is considered a PG13 space, the display of NSFW content is not allowed; as such, all nipples and genitalia must be covered while on display.


# Adult Material Rules

Adult-oriented displays and items are permitted in the Mature Dealer Section so long as they do not present illegal content. Anyone inside the Mature Dealer Section must abide by the rules presented in the Standards of Conduct.

Depiction of minors, real or fictional, in adult situations is strictly prohibited, either on display or for sale; such items may not be kept out of sight but available.  This rule applies to both the general Dealers Room and the Mature Dealer Section.


# Copyright

The responsibility to ensure proper copyright of merchandise rests with Dealerships. Fursquared recommends Dealers research and be aware of the legality of copyrights, trademarks, works of parody, and fan art. Artwork or merchandise that is known to be counterfeit is prohibited.


# Bags / Backpacks / Carts

Large roller bags or carts are also not allowed as they cause problems with traffic flow. Bluetooth speakers, excessive squeaker usage, or anything else that may be annoying to other attendees with sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch are also not allowed.


# Food & Drink

NOTE TO ALL: For Expo entry, drinks must be non-spillable... iow, you should be able to turn it upside down and nothing spills. (Open cans, drinks with lids that don't completely seal, etc., DO NOT COUNT.) Exception is granted to anyone with the "H" on the back of their badge (which should include all vendors). "H" badges are allowed to take drinks in (if vendors spill on their own stuff, that's their responsibility, and staff should know enough to be responsible).


# Waitlist

Vendors on the waitlist will be reached out to if there are any openings before 3 days of the con, and have 24 hours to respond. Any tables forfeited before noon on Friday will be given at staffsâ€™ discretion to who is available.
