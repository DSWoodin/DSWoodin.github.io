neural networks are effectively like function approximators that are inspired by the way the brain works
That’s called the [[explore exploit dynamic]]. So you can exploit which means show the thing that you’re most likely to engage with. Or you could explore, you could say, “Well, maybe once per day we’ll show Adam something totally random. If he interacts with it, then we’ve learned something really profound”

the teams that are really important are also almost always under the gun. And it’s very hard for them to have real freedom to pursue something.
