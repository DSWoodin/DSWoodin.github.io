Do you have a massive amount of emails or other digital "things" that need some attending to? You are not alone. There are a massive amount of results when you search for “digital clutter” on the internet, including [this great article](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/25-areas-of-digital-clutter-to-minimalize/) by Joshua Becker. Today, I’m sharing with you 3 steps to start tackling your digital clutter.

This is an area I've been dragging my feet on for years. I'd start tackling my digital clutter and then get overwhelmed and then forget about it again for another couple years. If that sounds like you at least a little bit, I hope my simple digital clutter challenge below will help you out.

## Clutter can affect so much in our lives.

Tackling your invisible digital clutter will make such a big difference once it’s tackled and you have a plan in place going forward too.

> “Clutter is not just the stuff on your floor – it’s anything that stands between you and the life you want to be living.” - Peter Walsh

### 3 steps to start tackling your digital clutter

If you don’t know where to start, these 3 steps to tackling your digital clutter is a great place to start. I plan to do the same too, as well as the extra steps in my digital declutter challenge below.

1. Unsubscribe from mail lists you no longer read. It goes without saying, but why have all the emails pop up that you don’t even enjoy reading, but end up deleting or piling up? Unsubscribe. One at a time. There are even websites like [this one](https://unroll.me/) to help you with that process.
2. Delete any photos, files, apps you no longer need. You can go through both your computer if you have one and phone for this task.
3. Create a plan for tackling future digital clutter. If you want to stay on top of the digital clutter, it’s imperative for you to create a simple routine going forward to do some maintenance digital decluttering.

## FREE DIGITAL DECLUTTER CHALLENGE AND CHECKLIST

A couple weeks ago I publicly said (to [my mail list](https://eastcoastkelly.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=581b5bf0ab44ab0870d2a00c0&id=3026fc64c7)) that no more [digital clutter](https://www.mindfulproductivityblog.com/blog/4-types-of-digital-clutter) for me. I need to go through it, start to finish. And. This is good news for you because you also reap the benefits of my work! I created a digital declutter challenge for tackling your digital clutter for myself and for you if you'd like it - [HERE](https://mailchi.mp/2537e5ab8d0f/free-digital-declutter-challenge).

#### What's in the digital decluttering challenge?

I added on ten tasks plus bonus ones if you want to do exactly what I'm planning on doing. It's not all encompassing because everyone's digital decluttering will likely look somewhat different, so you can always add on a couple extra tasks if needed. I'd also encourage you to think about a digital decluttering maintenance plan too after finishing it. I imagine some tasks will take me a while, but I'm going to go through one at a time. And then I'll head to my friend [Carleen on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carleenarmstead/) for inspiration as she has a great routine going on for weekly digital phone decluttering. You can find the digital decluttering challenge [here](https://mailchi.mp/2537e5ab8d0f/free-digital-declutter-challenge).

_Start tackling your digital clutter, bit by bit. The three steps described above will give you a nice jumping off point. Unsubscribe, unfollow, declutter. Repeat until you’re done!_
