### Yan Zhen Seminar

## Abstract

More and more mini-outbursts are discovered in the black hole X-ray transients in the last few years. During the mini-outbursts of two sources, the X-ray spectral state transitions similar to the main outburst are detected, which is inconsistent with previous results and the expectation of theory. Similar radio jet properties are also observed along with the different spectral states. I will introduce the recent progress and the implications of this topic.
