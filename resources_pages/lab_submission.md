### Student repositories
For every lab, we will create a repository (repo) for each student. For example,
if your CWL is `goatcabin` then for DSCI 521 lab 1 there will be a repository called
`DSCI_521_lab1_goatcabin`. To see a list of all repositories that you have access to,
navigate to the homepage of your year's organization; for example, for the 2020-21 cohort,
go to <https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2020-21>.

NOTE: please do not confuse your personal lab-specific repository with the general course
repository, which will be named something like `DSCI_521_platforms-dsci_students`. That
repo is public to all students and is where you can access lectures, due dates, readings, etc.

### Submission
We anticipate that you will clone your lab-specific repository and do your work from
within there. To submit your labs you must **both** push your work to <https://github.ubc.ca/> 
**and** submit your rendered HTML file to Canvas. Your assignment will come bundled with a short script
to render to HTML and push your work to Canvas. 
You can push changes as many times as you want before the deadline; only the final version will be graded.

### Deadline
The lab deadlines are given on the course repo and/or MDS calendar. **These are hard deadlines.** In particular,
when the deadline passes you will lose write access to the repository. The default deadline for labs is
Saturday at 6pm, but there may be some exceptions.

### Grades
You will receive your grades through Canvas.

#### Privacy notes

* Your lab repos are visible to yourself, your TAs, all the core MDS staff, and some github.ubc.ca system administrators.

* Although only the final version will be graded, _all_ of your commits will be viewable, so don't commit something
private (like your email password) to your lab repo. Committing something and then removing it
with another commit doesn't remove it from the git history! It is theoretically possible to pull all traces of
something out of the git history, but it's not fun and uses more advanced git features.

* <https://github.ubc.ca> and <https://canvas.ubc.ca/> are run on Canadian servers, so all your data will be kept within Canada.
