We homeschool year round and take breaks as needed currently. It's been what works best for our family. There are certainly times where we take it slower like around the holidays and summer season. Today, I'm sharing with you **our summer homeschool plans and routine for 2021**. 

## OVERVIEW OF OUR HOMESCHOOL

  
Our homeschool makeup compromises of four children ages ten to two. Three boys and a toddler girl, for reference. 

**Spine curriculum:** We use [Ambleside Online](https://www.amblesideonline.org/) and supplement or replace things here and there, such as for religion. Ambleside has pretty much laid out the path for how we go about homeschooling and let me let go of a lot of decision faitgue, which I am grateful for!
