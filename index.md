Organization Notes is a Zendesk Support application, which aims at improving your agents efficiency when dealing with tickets.

As your customer base grows, chances are that you're going to start having to support multiple organizations. Although at first your agents might be saving lots of documentation, bookmarks, or even mental notes on each customer, over time, this system won't scale. 

This application allows the agents to simply make their notes which will simply be available for all agents in each ticket. 

Having markdown allows the notes to make use of hiperlynks which can be used instead of bookmarks, use images in case it makes sense to enrich the notes, use lists, etc..!
