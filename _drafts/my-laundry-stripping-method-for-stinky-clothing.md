First off, my daily planning method is based on [the bullet journal method](https://amzn.to/3fB51uF). I've tweaked things over the years, so I'm going to share with you step by step how I daily plan with my simple daily planning method (for right now, that is). I like to switch things up sometimes!  
  
_I open my planner and write down the date for the next day_, usually the night before. Next to the date, _I also write down any appointments that I may have for that day or specific tasks_ that are at particular times (these are called "events" in the [bullet journaling](www.bulletjournal.com) world).

Next _I check my monthly calendar_ and _transfer any task or appointment_ that's for the next day into my planner (it's called the [daily log](https://help.bulletjournal.com/article/27-daily-log) in the bullet journaling world).

Then I check over _my weekly running to do list and transfer_ any that I'd like to get done the next day in my planner.

From there, as I'm going throughout my day, I cross off any tasks (see above) as they are completed with an "x". If something needs to move ahead because it was unifhished, I use a ">", and "<" when I need to transfer a task somewhere else if for a later date. Lastly, I cross out "---" if a task becomes irrelevant. [This method](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) is also something I learned from [the bullet journaling method](https://amzn.to/3fB51uF).

**Further reading?** I enjoyed the book [Eat that Frog](https://amzn.to/2DmKOdX) for planning and procrastination tips as well as the [Bullet Journal Method](https://amzn.to/3fB51uF) for simple planning (the method I use within my current planner setup in this blog).

_PS if youâ€™d like to chat about this method more with me, feel free to drop me a line at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _and Iâ€™ll also share my two favourite, simple videos for getting you started with the basics of the bullet journal method I learned from, too! You can also find more blogs on my simple planning method under the tag "simple planning" (click below)._

Cheers,
