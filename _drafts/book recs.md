Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time by Michael Shermer

Skeptic guide to the universe. The book I loaned out the most was always Demon Haunted world by Sagan. 

The Elephant of Belfast

Sans Famille (Alone in The World) by Hector Malot

A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. It's about aliens and space travel, sure. But it's really about how to be human, and all the different ways that are valid. Every time I read this book I learn new things about myself.

The House on the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune is all about personal growth and radical acceptance and might be my favorite new book in 2020.

Anger" by Thich Nhat Hanh

I’m on a similar journey and I’ve found learning about attachment theory and attachment styles to be so helpful. [“Attached”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888) seems to be the go-to for most people, however I found [“Polysecure”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52569124) to be far more helpful. You don’t have to be poly or even interested in being poly to get something from the book, all of the information in there is applicable to all relationship types. I really appreciate how the author of “Polysecure” uses trauma-informed research to expand on attachment theory/styles in a way “Attached” doesn’t, and think “Polysecure” does a better job of discussing parent/child relationships.
