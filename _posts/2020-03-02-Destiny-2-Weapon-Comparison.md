title: Destiny 2 Season of Dawn Weapons Retrospective
subtitle: Asking and answering the important question of why the best weapons were the best
---

When it comes to answering the question of "What's the best gun in Destiny 2 for PvP?" answering that question is fairly easy. All you need to do is head over to [Destiny Tracker's Insights page](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights) and see what the most used guns are, and those are probably the best. Answering the question of *why*, however, can be somewhat difficult, as there are a multitude of ways one weapon can hold an edge over another. From varying stats, differing time-to-kill (TTK) values between sub-types, different perk pools, or, in the case of exotic weapons, special abilities, these are just a few ways some weapons can rise in use amongst so many choices.

By far one of the most used types of primary weapons, and weapons in general, are hand cannons. These aptly-named slow-firing revolvers pack quite a punch, with most, if not all, being able to down an enemy guardian in a second or less. These weapons are killer in the hands of skilled players, usually knocking out an opposing guardian in three shots, and are also an exceptional primary weapon choice for midrange battles.
