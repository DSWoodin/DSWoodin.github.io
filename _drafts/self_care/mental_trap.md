 There is a certain mental trap you'll want to avoid... Some people do this:

1. They get anxious/ashamed when they "just don't get it".
2. In fear of "discovery", they stop asking for help or taking any initiative. 
3. They will pretend everything is fine, while waiting and hoping that something (they aren't sure what) will magically make the dread go away. 
4. Feeling some guilt, they stay long (but unproductive) hours to "make up for it". 
5. The stress gradually makes them burn out

If you think you're at risk for that, then...

1. Create a list of the topics that make you feel dread or anxiety, even if the feeling isn't logical.
2. Figure out which of those you can improve entirely on your own (e.g. from books) and which ones you need coworker help with (company processes, the product, etc.)
3. Write down some possible approaches to share (see next section)
4. **Talk to your boss** about your (A) concerns and (B) ideas.

The the conversation might have stuff like:

* "I'm concerned that I don't know enough about X." 
* "Do you have any small tasks I can do to familiarize myself with X?"
* "Which of my coworkers would I talk to about more detail on X?"
* "Are there any other topics where you think I should focus on?"

Remember, unless you're at a terrible company, your boss is *not* interested in going on some sort of witch-hunt for imperfection, they want to **get shit done**. 

**P.S.:** Don't worry *yet*, since it's just week 1. It's possible that your boss is working on getting the right kind of newbie-assignments lined up, which sometimes depends on scheduling and how busy coworkers are. Just keep monitoring the situation and communicate when necessary.
