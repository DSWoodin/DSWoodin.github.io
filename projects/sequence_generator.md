A TensorFlow-based LSTM model that can be used to mimic a sequence of any form with a common input/output method for all data types. This implementation uses a modified LSTM class from TensorFlow to output the trained model in a simple text format, making cross-platform usage of the model simpler. Currently, I am working on implementing a simple GUI for training a model and sampling its generated output.
