 Here are my picks for every year from this decade:

* Knausgaard's *My Struggle* (2010).

* Wallace's *The Pale King* (2011).

* Ferrante's *My Brilliant Friend* (2012).

* Pynchon's *Bleeding Edge* (2013).

* James' *A Brief History of Seven Killings* (2014).

* Ishiguro's *The Buried Giant* (2015).

* DeLillo's *Zero K* (2016).

* Saunders' *Lincoln in the Bardo* (2017).

* Burns' *Milkman* (2018).

* Ellmann's *Ducks, Newburyport* (2019).

A few of these were hard to pick, but I think that this was as good a decade for literature as any other. What do you think?
