After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I'm semi-retired but still good for the smaller stuff.

 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Put up a shelf
 - Fix a kitchen cabinet
 - Lay tiles
 - Silicone a bath or sink
 - Repair damaged walls or plasterboard
 - Clean up and re-paint a radiator

And much more. If you need something else I can probably give you a quote.

Jobs that I won't take on:
  - Longer jobs (more than 3 days)
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing (not even tap washers)
  - UPVC windows or doors
  - Extensive outdoor painting
  - Extensive flooring work
  - Digging
  - Ladder work (step ladders are OK)

How I work:
  - One free visit to discuss your job.
  - Free quote within one week.
  - Minimum charge Â£50 excluding materials.
  - Payment for materials up front.
  - Best efforts to schedule your job within one month and stick to the agreed date.
  - Making good and cleaning up is part of the service.
  - Invoice payable within one month.
