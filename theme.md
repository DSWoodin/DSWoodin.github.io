# Play along\!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Something seems to be amiss during the weekend's activities as this virtual convention seems to be a bit more than meets the eye.&nbsp; With glitches, interruptions and more abound, it's growing clear that whatever's happening is far more than just a bug in the software. It's up to YOU to figure out exactly what's going on behind the scenes\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the course of the weekend, various hints and clues will be showing up in all sorts of places.&nbsp; Once you make a temporary account at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you can begin collecting these codes that may be given out in a myriad of ways, so pay close attention to all of your conventional surroundings\!&nbsp; The more secret information you collect, the deeper into the story you will descend\!&nbsp; There are various forces at play over the weekend, and not all of them are on your side\!&nbsp; Although you *can* share the secret information you've discovered with others, keep in mind that others (including your fellow con-goers) might be working to achieve an opposing goal\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; This endeavor also coincides with activities on VR Chat, and although you don't NEED VR Chat to be able to participate, the content released on VR Chat can greatly enhance your experience with additional content\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; Your work begins now\!&nbsp; Keep your wits about you, and help save the convention (one way or another\!)
