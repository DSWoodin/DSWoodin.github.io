<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-user about-icon"></span>
I'm a series of spacetime events called Richard (or Ricardo in some circles). 
I am a first-gen American born to Cuban and Argentine parents (español es mi lengua materna).
I'm a high tech low-life, an outdoorsy great indoorsman; voice-activated, user-friendly, self-cleaning, and compostable. 
I'm a non-believer and an overachiever, laid-back but forward-thinking, a supercharged subversive, a hands-on footloose.

## Travel

- I have visited 28+ countries, done 3 major bicycle tours (Seattle ↣ San Francisco, around Taiwan, and around New Zealand), and been to 47 of 50 U.S. states.
- I've hitchhiked over 10,000 miles in the US, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand.
- I converted a jumbo news crew van into a tiny home and lived the van life for 2 years. It had roof solar, a fridge/freezer, and fit everything I owned!

## Talks and Interviews

- Ray Summit '21: 
  ["How Ray and Anyscale Make it Easy to do Massive-scale ML on Aerial Imagery"](https://raysummit.anyscale.com/content/Videos/dJRSr3NJLSP4h9CT8)
- Talk for TA3M Seattle: "How AI can be abused by surveillance
  states" ([presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfn3T7R-ufjbzfmlVSMgAIyjC6hYhTTC41LMleQNFcQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- Interview with KOMO news in Seattle over the net neutrality debate

## Volunteering

- I helped organize a Surveillance Self-Defense Workshop for Activists with TA3M Seattle.
- I organized and led a protest against Congress's plans to end the Internet's decentralized nature (downtown Seattle,
  December 2014).
- I volunteered for 1.5 months for a community in Mota Lava, Vanuatu. We brought an oil press to make virgin coconut oil.
- I volunteered for a whale monitoring survey to study how the world's largest LPG processing center
  would affect the world's largest Humpback whale calving area near James Price Point, Australia.

## Art

- I was Artist in Residence at the [Sir James Wallace Arts Trust](www.wallaceartstrust.org.nz) for a few months in 2015.
  A selection of my works are in circulation around public spaces in New Zealand. Links to my Flickr below!
- I find the intersection of art and machine learning fascinating.
  I [maintain a repository](https://github.com/crypdick/awesome-neural-art) of research projects and use AI art generators.

## IT

- **Cloud server** - I run various self-hosted services: Nextcloud, Plex, a Tor node, and more.
- **[Mobile library](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBox-Mesh)** - I converted a Raspberry Pi into an awesome
  mobile filesharing mesh network.
- **Personal Assistant** - I also converted a Raspberry Pi into a fully open-source digital assistant using Mycroft.ai.
- **Ultimate remote development workstation** - I am constantly improving my mobile workstation so that I can work anywhere while still being ergonomic. My current setup is a NReal AR headset, a 5G hotspot, and a remote tunnel.
