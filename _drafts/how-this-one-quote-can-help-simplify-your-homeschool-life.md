Are you often feeling like the days run into each other and homeschooling feels overwhelming more often than not? Ok, there will always be overwhelming, hard days in homeschooling, but there are definitely ways to simplify your homeschool life to reduce some overwhelm. I'll be sharing with you how this one quote can help simplify your homeschool life.   
   
 Identify the essential, eliminate the rest (link quote).   
   
 Applying this to homeschool life, this may take a bit of time, but really diving in and discovering the essential for your homeschool life is so key. For instance, we value getting outside and reading aloud, so we make sure that's apart of our homeschool.   
   
 Simplify your homeschool life with this one quote.   
   
 Identify the essential, elmininate the rest with the homeschool clutter. Take a look at your supplies and books on hand. Is it all used, loved, needed? Do you have far too much? Decluttering your homeschool space will go far in simplifying your homeschool life and lead to peaceful, tidier days. We have toddlers and preschoolers here, so focusing less has saved my sanity many times ha!

 I'm Kelly Briggs from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and have four children under ten. I’m an elementary teacher, turned homeschool mom eight years ago.  
   
 I help busy moms by sharing tips to simplify home life. I also offer a course for busy moms called Simplify your Home Life: a course for busy moms. I've found that it’s become even more important to discover what matters most as our children have aged. And simplifying our life at home and homeschool life has helped so much with that.
