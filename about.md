I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics since October 2020. I am supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/). I am part of the [HeKA Team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/), located in Paris, France.

I work at the interface between neuroscience and mathematics. More specifically, I focus on developing and adapting shape analysis tools to the quantitative analysis of fetal brain MRI. My goal is to provide better depiction of healthy brain growth and neurodevelopmental anomalies, along with enhanced diagnosis and prenatal counselling.
