PolarEscpae is a race game in which penguins need to pass a ball through the finish line, while going through an obstacle course. The player that passes the ball through the finish line – wins.
The game consists of a menu screen, how to play screen, 2 "regular levels", a special fire level, a credit screen and an end screen.
In the “regular” levels, the ground and obstacles are made of ice, and in the fire level they are made of lava and fire. The first “regular” level is relatively easy, while the second level contains moving surfaces and a harder obstacle course.
