The book itself is a good introduction to the canon, and has a more comprehensive list including more secondary works. Great road map for if you want to deep dive into a particular period or country’s literature. 

Towards the end the book turns into something of a polemic against Critical Theory (Marxist, feminist, deconstructive etc. readings of literature) — I just tune Bloom out when he starts to crankily rail against new-fangled literary ideas, because the rest of the book is so good.

What’s included and not included here is of course very debatable, but part of the fun is finding out how you’d disagree.
