 1. [The Annotated Turing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2333956.The_Annotated_Turing?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6DmPQiMHk9&rank=1). An annotated walkthrough of Turing's paper with historical background and other related discussion. I recommend in any thread similar to this. 

2. [The Dream Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722412.The_Dream_Machine). The complete history of the computer, focused on the internet starting with Alan Turing and up to the modern internet. Long but readable.
