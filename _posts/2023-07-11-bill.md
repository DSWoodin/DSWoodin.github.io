After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I've reached retirement age. These days I prefer less strenuous work but I'm still good for the smaller stuff.

Here are examples of jobs I can do for you:
 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Fit shelving
 - Fix kitchen cabinets

That's just a selection. If you have a different job, feel free to ask and if that's something I can do I'll give you a quote

Here are things I won't take on:
  - Longer jobs (three days maximum is a guide) 
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing (not even tap washers)
  - Double-glazed window or door systems
  - Extensive exterior painting
