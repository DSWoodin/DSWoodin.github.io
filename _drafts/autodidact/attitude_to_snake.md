 To hate snakes.
[[learning]]
EDIT: Looks like I have to address some comments.

Humans are not born with an innate fear of snakes, they're born to easily develop that fear. And the way human culture treats snakes, with them almost always being depicted as scary/villainous, plays a big role in how that develops in impressionable children.

It's okay to be afraid of snakes. What's NOT okay is to have and spread attitudes like "the only good snake is a dead snake." Just because an animal freaks you out, doesn't diminish its right to live in the slightest. Snakes do a lot of good for the world, and their overwhelmingly negative depiction in popular culture and especially abhorrent events like Rattlesnake Roundups needs to stop.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't teach a healthy level of respect, and that it's advisable to just pick up random snakes off the ground. But we do need to teach that they're not inherently scary or evil, and have just as much a right to live as "cute and cuddly" animals!
