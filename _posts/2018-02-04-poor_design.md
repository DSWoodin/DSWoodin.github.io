Here we will discuss why this [nutrition](http://nutrition.williams.edu/) site and its pages are poorly designed.

## Initial design thoughts

Unnecessary instruction: a lot of text may overwhelm users. "Parkesy Student Center" under "Places to Eat" is vague and 
should, in fact, specify the various stations within Paresky. The 
[Nutrition Home](http://nutrition.williams.edu/NetNutrition/Home.aspx/StartOver/) tab leads to a blank page. For aesthetic, 
"Places to Eat" could be in a tab bar at the top of the page.

## Choosing a tab

Tabs share redundant information with the 'Daily Menu' option and have no logical ordering. The note at the bottom is not 
needed here, potentially confusing users. Not shown: allergies check boxes at bottom of page, with no functionality.

## Daily Menu

Two back arrows with only one labeled. Having to go back-and-forth just to see the
different meals of the day for only the selected dining hall is quite frustrating - it would be nice to quickly switch between 
dining halls without needing to start over. Toolbars could really come in handy.
