Corporate culture has a significant impact on employee satisfaction and productivity. One slogan often used in organizations is "become to achieve" which advocates the importance of becoming proficient and acquiring skills before receiving promotions or opportunities.

On the one hand, this slogan promotes continuous improvement and personal development. Dweck's (2006) research on growth mindset suggests that a learning and improvement-oriented approach can contribute to career success.

However, the philosophy of "become to achieve" can also lead to potential pitfalls. The constant pressure to improve can result in burnout or frustration if opportunities don't materialize as expected. Moreover, the value of networking, mentorship and the importance of role-fit can be minimized.

The issue of overwork is an additional factor that deserves attention. The "become to achieve" culture can lead to a "work more" mentality, where employees may feel obligated to demonstrate their dedication through long working hours. Research, like that conducted by Virtanen et al. (2012), links overwork to a variety of health problems, including cardiovascular diseases and mental health issues.

Moreover, according to a study from Stanford University, overworking can, in fact, decrease productivity. Therefore, while continuous improvement and dedication are commendable, balance is vital.

To adopt the "become to achieve" philosophy in a healthy, productive and sustainable way, here are some tips:

1. **Set clear goals**: Knowing exactly what you want to achieve can help maintain focus and motivation.
2. **Learn to learn**: Develop effective learning skills. This includes learning to learn independently, as well as staying current with the latest trends and developments in your field.
3. **Maintain balance**: While it's important to work hard, it's also vital to have a healthy balance between work and personal life. This can include practicing relaxation activities, physical exercise and maintaining good sleep habits.
4. **Build a support network**: Having a good support system, whether from colleagues or mentors, can be extremely beneficial.
5. **Recognize your achievements**: Don't forget to celebrate your achievements along the way. This can help maintain motivation and self-confidence.

Adopting the "become to achieve" philosophy can be a powerful strategy for personal and professional development. However, it is essential that it is adopted in a healthy, productive and sustainable way. With focus, balance and support, professionals can embrace this philosophy while taking care of their well-being and achieving their career goals.

To recognize whether a company is offering a healthy "become to achieve" environment, readers can observe the following indicators:

1. **Promotion of work-life balance**: Does the company respect working hours and encourage employees to take time to rest and recharge?
2. **Learning and development opportunities**: Does the company offer training, workshops, mentorship programs, among other opportunities for employee's professional and personal growth?
3. **Recognition and reward**: Does the company regularly recognize and reward employee efforts and achievements?
4. **Open and transparent communication**: Is the company transparent in its decisions and keeps employees informed about organizational changes?
5. **Mental health support**: Does the company have mental health support programs and encourages open discussion about employee well-being?

## Conclusion
In conclusion, it's essential for organizations to adopt a balanced approach in promoting the "become to achieve" mindset. They should encourage growth and personal development while maintaining a healthy and sustainable work culture, taking into consideration other important aspects for career advancement.
