Neural Machine translation directly calculates
... a given wire happens to be carrying "$$\lvert 0\rangle$$."
By that we mean that it's carrying the linear combination
$$\begin{psmallmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{psmallmatrix}$$ ...

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
