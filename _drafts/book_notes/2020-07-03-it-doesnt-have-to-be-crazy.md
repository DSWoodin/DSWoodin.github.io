I fully and wholehearted support the idea of a calm workplace. That's why I was intrigued when I saw the title of this book. Although I don't have prior experience with Basecamp, I googled it and realised that it was a trusted startup.

I found that I largely agree with this book. I agree with the values of the authors / cofounders of the company and I agree that there is more to life than work.

### Summary / Notes

People who work at startups are invariably stressed out. The main reasons for that are -

- Work is the most distracting place there is. 
- Growth at any cost is a terrifying expectation that nevertheless is being thrusted on many employees.

There's always a guy at the office who brags about the sleep he got the previous night, as though he is supposed to be congratulated for it. `Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it’s a mark of stupidity.`

Given the fast paced growth of the tech world till now, one could assume that we have automated all there is to automate and that the time spent working would reduce. But it doesn't look like it has. People spend their days at the office and continue to work at home. Why this disconnect?

`There’s not more work to be done all of a sudden. The problem is that there’s hardly any uninterrupted, dedicated time to do it.`

Startups often lease open offices, probably to save on building costs, but the downside is that there are hundreds of distractions per second. 

Your company should be your best product. 

The hustle may have started as a beacon for those with little to outsmart those with a lot, but now it’s just synonymous with the grind.

Creativity, progress, and impact do not yield to brute force.

This language of war writes awful stories. When you think of yourself as a military commander who has to eliminate the enemy (your competition), it’s much easier to justify dirty tricks and anything-goes morals.

What’s our market share? Don’t know, don’t care. It’s irrelevant. Do we have enough customers paying us enough money to cover our costs and generate a profit? Yes. Is that number increasing every year? Yes.

Just a deep satisfaction with doing our very best work as measured by our happiness and our customers’ purchases.

simply forgetting about them and making the best damn product you know how?

But after chasing that goal for a while, we thought again. And the answer to “Why not?” became a very clear “Because (1) it’s disingenuous for us to pretend we care about a number we just made up, and (2) because we aren’t willing to make the cultural compromises it’ll take to get there.”

It’s no longer about simply making a great product or providing a great service. No, now it’s all about how this BRAND-NEW THING CHANGES EVERYTHING.

The sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you’ll be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance.

Depth, not breadth, is where mastery is often found.

Being comfortable in your zone is essential to being calm.

If you can’t fit everything you want to do within 40 hours per week, you need to get better at picking what to do, not work longer hours.

they fail to protect what’s both most vulnerable and most precious: their employees’ time and attention.

Meetings tend to break time into “before” and “after.”

A fractured hour isn’t really an hour—it’s a mess of minutes.

between all those context switches and attempts at multitasking, you have to add buffer time.

Productivity is for machines, not for people.

Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work.

A great work ethic isn’t about working whenever you’re called upon. It’s about doing what you say you’re going to do, putting in a fair day’s work, respecting the work, respecting the customer, respecting coworkers, not wasting time, not creating unnecessary work for other people, and not being a bottleneck.

Stop equating work ethic with excessive work hours.

Modern-day offices have become interruption factories.

The person with the question needed something and they got it. The person with the answer was doing something else and had to stop. That’s rarely a fair trade.

But what if you have a question on Monday and someone’s office hours aren’t until Thursday? You wait, that’s what you do.

That’s because no one can see anyone else’s calendar at Basecamp.

No butts-in-seats requirement for people at the office, no virtual-status indicator when they’re working remotely.

“But how do you know if someone’s working if you can’t see them?” Same answer as this question: “How do you know if someone’s working if you can see them?” You don’t.

The expectation of an immediate response is the ember that ignites so many fires at work.

Almost everything can wait. And almost everything should.

JOMO! The joy of missing out.

oblivious joy of focus rather than the frantic, manic fear of missing something that didn’t matter anyway.

“We’re all family here.” No, you’re not. Neither are we at Basecamp. We’re coworkers. That doesn’t mean we don’t care about one another. That doesn’t mean we won’t go out of our way for one another. We do care and we do help. But a family we are not. And neither is your business.

Basecamp is not “our baby.” Basecamp is our product. We’ll make it great, but we won’t take a bullet for it. And neither would you for yours.

We’re people who work together to make a product. And we’re proud of it. That’s enough.

Their motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional form of sacrifice: yours.


Because by invoking the image of the family, the valor of doing whatever it takes naturally follows.

Trying to supplant the family you likely already have is just another way to attempt to put the needs of the company above the needs of your actual family.

When the top dog puts in mad hours, the rest of the pack is bound to follow along.

If the only way you can inspire the troops is by a regimen of exhaustion, it’s time to look for some deeper substance.

Workaholism is a contagious disease.

“Another concept we talk a lot about is something called a ‘trust battery.’ It’s charged at 50 percent when people are first hired. And then every time you work with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise.”

With great power comes great ignorance.

An owner unknowingly scattering people’s attention is a common cause of the question “Why’s everyone working so much but nothing’s getting done?”

Evading responsibility with a “But it’s just a suggestion” isn’t going to calm the waters. Only knowing the weight of the owner’s word will.

We assume that picking it will be easy only because we’ve never tried to do it before.

The worst is when you load up these expectations on new hires and assume they’ll meet them all quickly. You’re basically setting them up to fail.

Remind yourself that other people’s jobs aren’t so simple. Results rarely come without effort. If momentum and experience are on your side, what is hard can masquerade as easy, but never forget that not having done something before doesn’t make it easy. It usually makes it hard.

The people who brag about trading sleep for endless slogs and midnight marathons are usually the ones who can’t point to actual accomplishments.

Continued sleep deprivation batters your IQ and saps your creativity.

A great night’s sleep enhances every waking hour.

The typical corporate give-and-take is that life gives and work takes.

We ask reasonable people to make reasonable choices, and the company will be reasonable right back. That’s balance.

The fact is that unless you hire someone straight out of an identical role at an identical company, they’re highly unlikely to be instantly up to speed and able to deliver right away.

The quickest way to disappointment is to set unreasonable expectations.

Stop thinking of talent as something to be plundered and start thinking of it as something to be grown and nurtured,

We’ve found that nurturing untapped potential is far more exhilarating than finding someone who’s already at their peak.

There are no stock options at Basecamp because we never intend to sell the company.

Churning through people because you’re trying to suppress the wages of those who stay just seems like poor business.

It seems so generous, but there’s also a catch: You can’t leave the office.

There’s an uncanny correlation between the companies with these kinds of benefits and the companies that can’t stop talking about the need to push work to the max.

we don’t offer gotcha benefits.

Open-plan offices suck at providing an environment for calm, creative work done by professionals who need peace, quiet, privacy, and space to think and do their best.

Rather than thinking of it as an office, we think of it as a library. In fact, we call our guiding principle: Library Rules.

The whole purpose of a vacation is to get away. To not only be somewhere else entirely, but to think about something else entirely. Work should not be on your mind. Period.

Time off isn’t much of a benefit if it can be taken right back.

Employers aren’t entitled to anyone’s nights, weekends, or vacations. That’s life time. True emergencies are an exception, but those should only happen once or twice a year max.

When companies act like they own all of their employees’ time, they breed a culture of neurotic exhaustion.

A dismissal opens a vacuum, and unless you fill that vacuum with facts, it’ll quickly fill with rumors, conjecture, anxiety, and fear.

Following group chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda.

ASAP chamber. All chat all the time conditions you to believe everything’s worth discussing quickly right now,

Important topics need time, traction, and separation from the rest of the chatter.

“If everyone needs to see it, don’t chat about it.”

They’re using it wrong. They need to do this or do that. But the reality is that specific designs encourage specific behaviors. If the design leads to stress, it’s a bad design.

Few things are as demoralizing as working on projects with no end in sight.

Our projects can only get smaller over time, not larger.

It’s when you try to fix both scope and time that you have a recipe for dread, overwork, and exhaustion.

When we present work, it’s almost always written up first. A complete idea in the form of a carefully composed multipage document.

people deceive themselves all the time. They think they can put in long hours for years “so I won’t have to do it later.” You may not have to do it, but you probably will do it. Because it’s a habit.

When calm starts early, calm becomes the habit. But if you start crazy, it’ll define you.

Later is where excuses live. Later is where good intentions go to die. Later is a broken back and a bent spirit.

Someone in charge has to make the final call, even if others would prefer a different decision. Good decisions don’t so much need consensus as they need commitment.

We’ve been practicing disagree and commit since the beginning, but it took Bezos’s letter to name the practice.

It’s not just decide and go, it’s decide, explain, and go.

Knowing when to embrace Good Enough is what gives you the opportunity to be truly excellent when you need to be.

Being clear about what demands excellence and what’s perfectly okay just being adequate is a great way to bring a sense of calm into your work.

Always keeping the door open to radical changes only invites chaos and second-guessing.

Accept that better ideas aren’t necessarily better if they arrive after the train has left the station. If they’re so good, they can catch the next one.

Sometimes you have to fight against the obvious. And sometimes you have to recognize that time in doesn’t equal benefits out. Doing nothing can be the hardest choice but the strongest, too.

You can never get back to people fast enough, right?


Wrong.


Answering hundreds of emails every day within a minute or two just isn’t sustainable. The team that had beamed with pride over hitting those numbers started getting stressed out.

We’ve frequently been trapped by things that used to work well but no longer do.

There are many reasons to be skeptical of best practices, but one of the most common is when you see someone deriving them purely from outside observations about how another company does it:

Whatever it takes is an iceberg. Steer clear lest it literally sink your ship.

Reasonable expectations are out the window with whatever it takes.

Questions bring options, decrees burn them.

The only way to get more done is to have less to do.

It’s not time [[Management]], it’s obligation elimination.

Peter Drucker nailed it decades ago when he said “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”

We traded some revenue for some time.

Big teams make things worse all the time by applying too much force to things that only need to be lightly finessed.

Just like work expands to fill the time available, work expands to fill the team available.

“Pull-offs” can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that someone senior has a new idea that Just Can’t Wait.


These half-baked, right-in-the-middle-of-something-else new ideas lead to half-finished, abandoned projects that litter the landscape and zap morale.

Happiness is shipping: finishing good work, sending it off, and then moving on to the next idea.

If you say yes now, it’s harder to say no later.


No is calm but hard.


Yes is easy but a flurry.

A lot of entrepreneurs are addicted to risk.

Taking a risk doesn’t have to be reckless. You’re not any bolder or braver because you put yourself or the business at needless risk. The smart bet is one where you get to play again if it doesn’t come up your way.

Without profit, something is always on fire. When companies talk about burn rates, two things are burning: money and people. One you’re burning up, one you’re burning out.

The problem with per-seat pricing is that it makes your biggest customers your best customers. With money comes influence, if not outright power.

First, since no one customer can pay us an outsized amount, no one customer’s demands for features or fixes or exceptions will automatically rise to the top. This leaves us free to make software for ourselves and on behalf of a broad base of customers, not at the behest of any single one or a privileged few.

With the Fortune 5,000,000 we have a real shot at making a real impact.

Selling to small businesses and selling to enterprises take two very different approaches with two very different kinds of people.

but only shipping will tell you whether you’re going to sink or swim.

But if you want to know, you have to put it on the market.

Real answers are only uncovered when someone’s motivated enough to buy your product and use it in their own natural environment—and of their own volition. Anything else is a simulation, and simulated situations give you simulated answers.

We’ve always wanted customers to judge the product they could buy and use today, not some imaginary version that might exist in the future.

We honestly don’t know what we’ll be working on in a year, so why act like we do?

That’s what promises lead to—rushing, dropping, scrambling, and a tinge of regret at the earlier promise that was a bit too easy to make.

Promises are easy and cheap to make, actual work is hard and expensive. If it wasn’t, you’d just have done it now rather than promised it later.

Our ideas hijacked and attributed elsewhere.


That’s life! If you want to be calm, you have to move on.

Besides, copying does more harm to the copier than to the copied. When someone copies you, they are copying a moment in time. They don’t know the thinking that went into getting you to that moment in time, and they won’t know the thinking that’ll help you have a million more moments in time. They’re stuck with what you left behind.

What people don’t like is forced change—change they didn’t request on a timeline they didn’t choose.

For many customers, better doesn’t matter when comfort, consistency, and familiarity are higher up on their value chain.

Sell new customers on the new thing and let old customers keep whatever they already have.

Getting things off the ground is so hard that it’s natural to expect it’ll just get easier from here. Except it doesn’t. Things get harder as you go, not easier. The easiest day is day one. That’s the dirty little secret of business.

On day one, every startup in the world is in business. On day one thousand, only a fraction remain standing. That’s reality. So pace yourself. Don’t burn out early thinking the hard part is behind you.

When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says “It’s no big deal” or the token that says “It’s the end of the world.”

Whatever the pressures, there’s no law of nature dictating that businesses must grow quickly and endlessly.

Maintain a sustainable, manageable size. We’d still grow, but slowly and in control.

A business is a collection of choices. Every day is a new chance to make a new choice, a different choice.
