Fur Squared is a furry convention typically held in Brookfield, WI

### Q: Will there be a Fur Squared in 2022?

Probably!  We're doing some finishing touches on the contract, and hope to announce our final dates this week.  We're aiming to be in April.

### Q: Is Fur Squared 2022 a physical, in person event?

Yes!  We will be at the Sheraton Milwaukee Brookfield hotel, where we've always been!

### Q: What is your COVID-19 policy?

We will provide a full document soon, but, to put it simply: we will be requiring proof of vaccination, and we will be requiring masks to be worn at all times on hotel premises.  We understand that some people aren't able to be vaccinated, but unfortunately these measures are necessary for the safest event possible.


### Q: How can I keep up with what’s happening with the con?

We’ll be posting updates here on the website as well as on Twitter at [http://www.twitter.com/fursquared](http://www.twitter.com/fursquared) and on Telegram at [https://t.me/fursquared](https://t.me/fursquared)\!&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Q: I have a question not on this page. What can I do?

Preparation for Fur Squared 2022 has been really ramping up recently, and a lot of things that we’ve been quietly working on are about to be ready to get announced. Some things that you don’t see here are things we haven’t announced yet\! This page will be updated as we release more information. But if you have a question, check out [http://www.fursquared.com/contact](http://www.fursquared.com/contact) for a breakdown of who to contact about what, ask in the Fur Squared chat, or reach out to us on Twitter\!&nbsp;
