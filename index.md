### Bio

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/thrall_headshot_2022.JPG">
Hello and welcome! I recently received a PhD from the Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's <a href="https://niehaus.princeton.edu/">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>; in Fall 2023, I will join Columbia University's <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/">Political Science Department</a> as Assistant Professor, where I will also be associated with the <a href="https://www.siwps.org/programs/the-politics-and-global-economy-page-lab/">Politics and the Global Economy (PaGE) Lab</a> at the Saltzman Institute. I study the politics of business, primarily at the international level; topics of particular interest include international economic law, taxation, public-private governance, and diplomacy. Some of my work has been published in <i>International Organization</i>, <i>The Review of International Organizations</i>, <i>International Studies Quarterly</i>, and <i>Business and Politics</i>.
