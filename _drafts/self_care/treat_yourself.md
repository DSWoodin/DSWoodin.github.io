 Treat yourself the way you treat your lovers. Date yourself. Rediscover old hobbies, try new ones, make mistakes, be a huge beautiful mess and experiment.

I was told a story once about self-love and self-validation that goes a little something like this:

Imagine in your home is a huge beautiful kitchen, stocked with every kind of ingredient. You can make anything in this kitchen you could ever possibly want to eat, and you do.

One day, someone shows up at the door offering you a pizza. It's nice not to have to make it yourself, so you enjoy happily. Then the person at the door says "if you want more pizza you have to do X". They also say things like "nobody else will ever offer you pizza" (how would they know that?) or "you must only ever eat my pizza, not your own" (why would they care?) or "you don't deserve this pizza unless you..." (i mean i think everybody deserves pizza, so draw your own conclusions of why they are saying this to you), etc. etc.

Now... you could do X and Y and Z and follow all these rules and get the pizza, like they want. But the more you do this, the easier it is to forget that you have your own kitchen, and you can make your own pizza. You have to make it yourself, but you've done it before, or you can look up recipes if you need to - it's not secret knowledge!

So when one day the person at the door asks for way way WAY too much in exchange for this pizza, or tries to make you feel bad for asking for the pizza (that they offered!) or or or....

...You can shut the door. And make your own damned pizza.

It's not going to taste the same, but it's not going to taste *worse,* and you can make it whenever you want with no commentary, and enjoy it your own way on your own time. And I think that makes it more than worth doing.

You just have to take the time to figure out how to make your own pizza.
