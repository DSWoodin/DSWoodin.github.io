## MY SIMPLE PLANNER

My Simple Planner is developed based upon my own planning method, inspired by the [bullet journaling method](www.bulletjournal.com). Ready to simple plan already? You can purchase YOUR simple planner [HERE](https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/cs_live_a1V8z7jEcwDOTYn2NeGPRdmZpxSRLM51CHXucp3TNQPw1qC9VuP8aS3z9D#fidkdWxOYHwnPyd1blppbHNgWjA0T1FER31HQU9yUnJyMzJzUklDRGd3TEZHRlJVNGJJVUhvbm5haXdGN2BQdEJmRkprbnJCfWBHSjB1aWJxQ1w3S05tf0hUTVR0aE52PUlNYmYzYEo9T09ENTVBaExHUE5qbScpJ3VpbGtuQH11anZgYUxhJz8nNz1qNTdkMlJGYFJQYWdsNmZiJyknd2BjYHd3YHcnPydtcXF1dj8qKnJycit2bGh1aWBtamhgaGpoK2ZqaConeCUl).

##### THE DETAILS:

**Who's My Simple Planner for?** _My Simple Planner is perfect for you if you are a beginner planner, but also have some experience with making to do lists (and losing them). It's for you if you want to get better at planning, but don't know where to start and also get overwhelmed at all of the planning choices out there._

**Why My Simple Planner over another planner?** _I can't tell you my planner is better than the rest because we all have different preferences, but I can tell you that my planner is based on my own planning methods that have been both simple and effective for me with unscrambling my mom brain! I've create My Simple Planners to be visually appealing, yet minimalistic._
