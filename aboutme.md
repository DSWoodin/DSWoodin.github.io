ðŸ‘‹Hi I'm your host Irfan Habib!

I'm a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience, I have leveraged my expertise to drive innovation and technical growth in data engineering and architecture roles. Currently, I'm Tech Lead for Data Infrastructure at GoCardless, where I lead data infrastructure initiatives, developing key frameworks and strategies to enhance data quality, governance, and machine learning applications.

Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in a wide array of technologies and methodologies, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google BigQuery, Data Warehousing, and Software Project Management. My experience in Go (Programming Language), Apache Airflow, Python, and MLOps empowers me to drive continuous innovation in data engineering.
