 This is further up the leadership chain than your average Engineering Manager.  
Most of my EM friends HATE forcing their engineers to come in.  
Usually some C-level douche-bro wants to walk around their office and see hundreds of faced "wired in" so they feel like they're always making money.  
The idea of an empty office to them signifies the same emotional feeling as a failing company. Changing this mind state literally requires changing your CEO/CTO.  
We had literal metrics for our office, showing that we completed more features and had less outages during a WFH period that we tested. Our CEO just said, "I think it's hard to quantify how important face to face communication is, but it's very important for a growing company" and then refused to take any questions about WFH going forward.  
He's out of touch, but what can we do, fire him? When engineers quit because of a lack of shared ideals with management, he just blames other middle managers so it's never really his fault even though his ideology is what shapes the policies that HR enforces.
