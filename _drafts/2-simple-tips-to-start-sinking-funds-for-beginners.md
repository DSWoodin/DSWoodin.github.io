Have you heard of [sinking funds](https://www.everydollar.com/blog/what-is-a-sinking-fund) before? It's a new term for me, but we've been doing sinking funds the last while without realizing it. Today on the blog, I'm sharing 2 simple tips to start sinking funds for beginners.

## What's a sinking fund? 

> "A sinking fund is a sum of money that you set aside (usually by saving a bit each month) that's completely separate from your savings account." – From [thebalance.com](https://www.thebalance.com/sinking-funds-2385686)

### What are some benefits of sinking funds if you’re a beginner to any kind of budgeting? 

* They prevent you from dipping into your savings / debt reduction funds. 
* They can help you to become more intentional with your spending.. 

See more benefits of sinking funds [here](https://crazytogether.com/sinking-funds-need-love/).  
   
Right now, we have a sinking fund for our basement reno. We're not going into debt to complete our reno as we set a specific goal and have been setting aside money monthly (and in turn being better stewards of our finances to actually save for it faster). 

## 2 simple tips to start sinking funds for beginners

1. _Start with one category for setting aside money in a sinking fund._ It could get really overwhelming really quickly if you create many at one time. 
2. _Start small._ If you have debt, for instance, you may need to make your sinking funds a lot smaller in the meantime. But, you can create sinking funds for predictable things like Christmas sinking funds or birthday sinking funds.
