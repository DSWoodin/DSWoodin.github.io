With 20+ years of experience in AI and Machine Learning, both industry and academia, my roles varied from a Software Developer, Lead Applications Developer, IT Consultant, Research Staff and Senior Lecturer. One element that stayed constant in my previous jobs is <b>Public Speaking</b> and <i>“getting tech stuff explained with ease”</i>.

I love creating content, delivering it through presentations, demos, talks and raising awareness. I’m passionate about helping developers' communities in getting the most out of their software tools and applications. I share my content on my social media links below.
