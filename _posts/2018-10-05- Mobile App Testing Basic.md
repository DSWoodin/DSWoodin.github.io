Everywhere you look today, the tide of protectionist sentiment is flowing. Someone might be talking to his friends, someone might be looking at the weather forecast before leaving the house or sitting at home ordering food. Someone is scrolling through Facebook unnecessarily again. People are using mobile devices from waking up to sleeping. In the last few years, the development of mobile applications and mobile devices has led to the need for mobile testing. Currently, not all of these companies are developing mobile applications, and 84% of them are planning to enter mobile apps development in the near future.
One study found that 50 percent of mobile applications are used only once after download, and if a user encounters a bug only once, more than 50 percent of users delete the application from the mobile device.

_Qucik Link to Specific Topic:_

From this, you can understand how important mobile testing is for the success of any organization. Mobile application development and testing are much more challenging due to the different operating systems (iOS and Android), screen size, and resolution.
We use our phones in different places. At home, we are using high-speed Wi-Fi while walking. 4G, 3G and sometimes where there is no internet connection. We should always think about the most effective way to test the application to deal with complications. Let's take a look at some of the best practices in mobile application testing:

One of the best practices for mobile application testing is testing on real devices. The use of emulators and simulators plays an effective role in testing in the early stages of development. The application needs to be tested on a real device so that the tester can understand that the test results are realistic. Testing on real devices also gives the tester a better idea of ​​general usability.

Fix your device and operating system before testing. There are thousands of Android devices and hundreds of iOS devices in the market. When you test your company's application, always choose the device that most of your customers use. For example, iPhone 8, iOS 10.1.
If you do not know which device the customer is using, select the most used devices in the market. You can easily find this data through Google search. In addition to Google Analytics, there are many such analytics tools available online.

Always think about the edge cases, imagine you are a phone user and you use the app while walking you will probably find slow internet, not Wi-Fi when you are in the office. Check your application for a slow internet connection.

Check battery consumption rate, Power-Hungry applications have a higher rate of removal from devices. Check how much battery your application consumes. If you notice "Hmm, this device is getting hot" then report this too. This could be a good start for the investigation. Also, from the settings of the mobile phone, you can see how much battery it is consuming.

Always check that your application supports horizontal mode, you can catch a lot of visual problems just by turning the phone 90 degrees!

What are the types of mobile applications?

Native applications are installed from the App Store, such as Google Play for Android and Apple's App Store. Applications that can be installed and run on your devices are known as native applications. For example, Facebook and WhatsApp.

Web applications, web applications run from mobile web browsers to Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc. using mobile networks or Wi-Fi. For example, www.m.nba.com and www.m.amazon.com.

Hybrid application, a hybrid application is a combination of native application and web application. They can run on devices or offline and are prepared using web technologies like HTML 5 and CSS. eBay is an excellent example of a hybrid application.

Nowadays mobile testing is an on-demand profession and it is always useful to know how to do mobile testing. Also, as a mobile software tester, you have a lot of opportunities for freelancing. Many organizations hire remote testers to test their applications.
