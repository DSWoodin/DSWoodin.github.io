Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher specializing in energy systems, policy design, and techno-economic modeling.

## Research

The purpose of my work is to enable evidence-based decision making. I research sustainable energy systems, the effects of alternative policy choices, and how to design climate policy that best meets societal goals. 

My research is interdisciplinary, leveraging diverse methods matched to the problem at hand. I specialize in operations research, and integrate tools and ideas from other fields including economics, data science, and political science.

## PhD project

My PhD focuses on the impact of investor uncertainty and risk aversion on clean energy deployment, and on how de-risking climate policies may accelerate decarbonization. For this purpose I am developing stochastic optimization models that address these questions in the contexts of power system planning and EV charging station investments. 

Broadly, this work is motivated by the question of *how* might governments drive decarbonization *at the requisite speed*. There is currently a misalignment between climate tagets and the speed of clean energy investment and diffusion. The first publication of my PhD shows this in the case of electric vehicles (EVs). We synthesize estimates from decarbonization pathways to understand the role EVs play in future vehicle fleets under given climate targets - finding that decarbonization generally entails that most vehicles are EVs by 2050. We combine this with a fleet turnover model to explore the implications this has for how quickly EV diffusion must take place.

My current work focuses on the problem of investor uncertainty and risk aversion as barriers to clean energy investments. In my second research project, I am using Stochastic Dynamic Programming to model investments in EV charging stations and the potential for de-risking policies to speed up investments. In my later work, I am leveraging stochastic optimization and complementarity methods to develop a power system model that addresses these questions in the context of renewable investments.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel/groups/emesp#/view/about)), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators on climate policy, served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing, and briefed senior staff at Fortune Global 500 companies. My work on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System was featured in the EU Parliament and the EU Commission, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books, climbing, and cross-country skiing.
