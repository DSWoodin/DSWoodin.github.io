 With this post, I begin a new journey.
 
 General Artificial Intelligence is something that has always been able to spark a flame of the best kind of curiosity there is within me, but, in a sense, even though it would be obvious to do so, it is a curiosity I've never actually persued to develop into actuall founded knowdledge.
 
 With the start of my master's degree and the open question of a thesis project, I think the time is nigh to get my hands on this matter once and for all.
 
 This is my first post of what will be a recopilation of material, publications and personal notes on the current state of the art in the ambit of General Artificial Intelligence.
 
 Also, in this header notes I might ramble a little. Sorry for that. 
 
 I think it is within the blood: as much as I wanted this to be as straight to the point as I could make it, one cannot avoid giving their ego a voice. At least when it comes to that one being me.
 
 Let us begin.

With this very first post(s?) I aim to get a general view of the current state of General Artificial Intelligence, as well as the current open approach paths.
