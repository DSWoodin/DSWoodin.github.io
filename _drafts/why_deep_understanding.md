 It’s not your fault. Understanding “why” is something not a lot of us really get a chance to properly learn growing up. It’s not even like I really understood these types of things until I went to college and was exposed to *way* more people and experiences than I ever had before that I really began to understand these types of things. I had good parents who taught me how to be compassionate, but it can be difficult to actually learn how until you’re forced to interact with people that don’t think about, and experience, life the same way you do.

It’s also why people tend to talk past each other in the internet. In fact, I did exactly that earlier today, and it wasn’t until the person I responded to replied again that I was able to understand what they said. The internet is a *great* place to meme, waste time, etc. However, you have to consciously decide to understand people online in a way that doesn’t involve looking at a tangible person, hearing their voice as it cracks, and being personally involved. You have to be good with words, extra good to make up for all the non verbal communication you lose, and most people aren’t good with words. 

Fuck, I’m not good with words 90% of the time. I just got lucky, and was able to put down my jumbled thoughts in a way that made sense. Catch me again this afternoon as I proceed to rapidly insert my foot into my mouth in some way, or meme the night away. 

I do hope this helps people begin to understand why “it’s just a joke” is often not as good of an excuse as it sometimes sounds. Yeah, if you’re with friends, and you’re *all* cracking derogatory jokes about each other, that’s fine. However, many people think it’s appropriate to carry that same attitude out into the world around them, and that is downright dangerous. Strangers aren’t our friends, nor are they obligated to put down their life experiences to cater to a stranger that thinks offense can be excused by humor.

Remember: when people are offended, it is *rarely* the actual words themselves that are what is causing the offense. Women who actually enjoy just being in the kitchen would probably still be offended by the “get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich” jokes.

It’s when we start thinking about what those words actually mean, what assumptions those words are making, that is when we start to understand each other.
