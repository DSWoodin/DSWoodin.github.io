Sans Famille (Alone in The World) by Hector Malot

A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. It's about aliens and space travel, sure. But it's really about how to be human, and all the different ways that are valid. Every time I read this book I learn new things about myself.

The House on the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune is all about personal growth and radical acceptance and might be my favorite new book in 2020.
