## PROBLEM
  
WCMA’s greatest asset is not just solely its collection but the degree to which visitors can engage with and experience the objects on an intimate level – however, there is one glaring problem with visitor engagement at WCMA: not all visitors truly get the opportunity to experience the secret stories of these precious objects nor do they all get to add their own chapter. If a Williams student is lucky, they can participate in the wonderful WALLS program. If a faculty member is so inclined, they can select and display works from the collection to add a new dimension to their teaching. But what of the many visitors each year who are neither students nor faculty, what of the hundreds of tourists and alumni who watch the joyful and enriching experiences of students and professors as they interact closely with WCMA’s collection but are unable to participate? 

How can WCMA make sure that those visitors who are just passing through can still experience the rich depth of WCMA’s collection, see that these objects have lives of their own (some stretching back centuries), and leave their mark on this collaborative space for learning and appreciating art?

This problem actually arises from deeper analysis of WCMA’s greatest strengths as a museum with very unique qualities. WCMA is able to offer opportunities for engagement with its wide-ranging collection that would not be feasible at other museums. However, most of these opportunities are limited in scale and are not available to everyone who visits the museum. 
  
## SOLUTION  
  
Our solution is to make the reading room (shown below), an underutilized space that seems to perplex visitors as they meander through the galleries upstairs, into an interactive space where visitors can choose works from the collection to curate their own virtual exhibition. This will be done through the installation of a large touch screen displaying an online application, inspired by the interior design aspect of the video game The Sims (shown below), where visitors can click and drag 3-D renderings of works from the collection throughout a virtual version of WCMA.

The curation application will serve simultaneously as a museum map, a catalogue of the collection, and a place for interactions between visitors who find connections with specific works. The curation application will also be available for use on WCMA’s website.

This application allows visitors of all kinds, even visitors to WCMA’s website, to engage with the collection in a personal way and to take a piece of it with them in the form of a saved virtual exhibition that will be tied to their personal account made with the museum website. Integrating the application into touch displays in the library will allow visitors to take inspiration from their museum visit without being distracted while viewing the actual exhibitions themselves. The social media aspect of the curation application, where visitors comment on works in the collection and other people’s saved exhibitions, encourages a sense of community based around engagement with the collection.
