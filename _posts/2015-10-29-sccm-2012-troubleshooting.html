<h2>
Client-side logging</h2>
<br />
By default, the client-side logging level is set to the value 1 in the registry. This means that<br />
Configuration Manager logs only Information, Warning, and Error messages. To enable<br />
verbose logging for those Configuration Manager logs that support it, do the following:<br />
1. Open Registry Editor and find:<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CCM\Logging\@GLOBAL\LogLevel<br />
2. Change the value of LogLevel from 1 to 0 (note that you will need to change the<br />
permissions for Administrators to have Full Control in order to change this value).<br />
3. Restart the SMS Agent Host service.<br />
<br />
<h2>
Client-side debug logging</h2>
For even greater detail, you can enable debug logging. To enable debug logging for<br />
Configuration<br />
Manager logs, do the following:<br />
1. Open Registry Editor and find:<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CC\Logging<br />
2. Create a new key called DebugLogging.<br />
3. Create a new value of type REG_SZ under this key and name it Enabled.<br />
4. Set the Enabled value to True.<br />
5. Restart the SMS Agent Host service.
