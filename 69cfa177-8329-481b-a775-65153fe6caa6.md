 On foreign policy, I can recommend [Pax Indica](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15750844-pax-indica) by Shashi Tharoor (his experience at the UN as well as his time having been MoS for External Affairs helps), and [Does the Elephant Dance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9751005-does-the-elephant-dance-contemporary-indian-foreign-policy) for a more detailed discussion of the history of Indian foreign policy.
