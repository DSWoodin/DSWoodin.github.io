### My story

With a Bachelor's degree in Fine Art, I have been captivated by diverse social issues, channeling my creativity onto the canvas. My previous career enriched this perspective, as I supported problem solvers and witnessed firsthand how creative solutions could be applied in real-world scenarios.

In recent years, I have delved into the tech world, mastering frontend and backend development with JavaScript. This journey was propelled by my ambition to become a comprehensive problem-solver, blending the the structured approach of programming with the innovative problem-solving techniques from my art background.

My interest in cybersecurity is growing as I recognize the critical need to protect data and privacy in our increasingly digital society. As I learn, I am beginning to incorporate cybersecurity best practices into every aspect of my work, aiming to deliver creative security solutions to any potential challenges. As I continue my studies, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply and further develop my skills in the cybersecurity field.
