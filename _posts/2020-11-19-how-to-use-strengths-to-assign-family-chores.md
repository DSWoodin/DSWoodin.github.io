_Working from our strengths._ Everyone of us has different gifts, skills, things we like, and strongly don't like (handwashing dishes is my nemesis). A couple months ago, I had an idea pop into my head to focus more on our strengths when working together as a family vs expecting similar from everyone. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about how to use strengths to assign family chores.

**Examples of what I mean by working from our strengths**:

My husband really enjoys cooking, tidying the kitchen, and going for walks with the kids.

I really enjoy planning, managing a home, and laundry.

My oldest enjoys fixing things and running small errands to fetch things. He also enjoys serving others a lot and baking. 

My youngest boy enjoys mopping, eating, and running. He's 4.5, so for him it's the little things right now. 

I enjoy all things managing the home. 

My middle boy enjoys reading, so he often reads with his younger siblings. 

I enjoy vacuuming. 

So, we focus on those things. If I know someone really hates sweeping, but enjoys vacuuming, I go with that. 

[Here's a blog](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/uncategorized/age-appropriate-chores/) with more suggested chores that families can do together. 

So oftentimes now we keep in mind the things we are good at and what makes us happy! Asking my husband to take the kids for a walk while I tidy the home in peace is often a win. Win for us, for instance. It applies to so many areas too. Of course, there's the lesson that sometimes you've got to do things you don't like.. Like dirty dishes, but at least working from our strengths helps to make our home run much smoother. 

Little tweaks like this can make a big difference. 

_PS if you'd like a list of fifty ideas of chores you can do as a family, feel free to email me at simplehomemom@gmail.com and I can send that off to you._ 

**Did you enjoy this blog? If so, it would mean the world to me if you shared it!** 

Thank you,
