And now the moment everyone has been waiting for, the end of this series! (For methodology and introduction, please see the [first post in the series](/2022-12-01-top50-part1/).) The bestest game in the whole world is...

### 1. Great Western Trail (2016)

Great Western Trail! What a game! Shooting past Burgundy and Birmingham since last time around. I like it so much that I upgraded to the second edition earlier this year -- after testing a friend's copy. You can't go wrong with either editions, but I like the upgrades they have done -- both graphically (The cowboys have hats(!), the game is slightly more inclusive, and I can finally get rid of the ugliest game cover in my collection!), and also the small rules tweaks (the draw/discard tokens that has been backported from Rails to the North, the nerfing of delivering to Kansas (this can easily be house ruled, of course), the new _upgradeable_ cows, etc). There are even official solo rules that are non-fiddly and fun. I don't think Rails to the North is _needed_ but it does add variation, so I'm happy it has been released for the second edition as well. (For even more variation on the same theme and mechanisms I'm looking forward to try out Great Western Trail: Argentina and the upcoming New Zealand.)

### Best game per year

Another interesting way to look at this is my favourite game per release year:

(I've added games for the missing years as well...)

We can also numpy that the median year on the top 50 list is 2018 (the mean is 2016.51 (if we disregard our blatant outlier)).

Or pyplot it, like so:

## Conclusion

I guess the conclusion here must be that either board games are getting better -- or I'm heavily influenced by the cult of the new...

It is tempting to do as [Rahdo](https://www.youtube.com/user/rahdo/videos) does and update my ratings to reflect this ranking. Probably by rating number 1 at 9.50, number 2 at 9.49 etc... Also, I wonder what would have happened if I expanded my criteria to all games that I've rated higher than 8.5? (Apart from the fact that the number of [PubMeeple](https://www.pubmeeple.com/ranking-engine) comparisons would skyrocket, of course...) Would things shift around? Probably. It would also be tempting to program my own similar ranking engine with the added functionality of visualising the resulting graph... (To see how many loops there are...)

Voilà, **God Jul** everybody!
