Do not include months when you add dates for your jobs.

Show your skill, the problem you solved, and how it benefited the project.

for women, there is a serious economic and social penalty for not being liked.

Do not name a number first. No naming of numbers first. Here’s your script: “The salary you offer me tells me a lot about this company, and I think it’s really important for me to have that information so I can compare you with my other offers.

I’m happy to give you some time; why don’t I follow up with you tomorrow if I haven’t heard your offer by then? I know it can take some time to get the i’s dotted!”

Never, ever say yes to the first offer.

You’ll be negotiating with a professional salary negotiator in human resources, and their job is to make you doubt yourself and your value just enough that you’ll take the first offer, gratefully.

“That’s a great place to start! I understand that you cannot go outside the salary band, so let’s work on finding other ways to get your offer commensurate with my others, because I love this company and I really want to find a way to work here. What can you do in the way of stock options and telecommuting? If you can contractually add two days a week where I don’t have to fight Seattle traffic, we’re all winners!”

“I’m here and interested in this job because I think your company is extraordinary, not average. I don’t think you want to fill this company with average developers, and I don’t think you’d be offering me this opportunity if you did. Glassdoor has a salary for someone of my abilities and training at [number that is at least 20 percent more than what they cited you]. Is that a little closer to what the amazing people I’ve met so far have started at?”

They’re testing to find out how far they can push you and whether you’ll put up with sexist humor that has no kindness or irony behind it.

It’s OK to buy liberty and utility with money instead of physical possessions.

If you’ve found yourself in a dead-end job with no promotion in sight, it’s time to change your perspective. It’s no longer just about your skill set; it’s about your network, your image, and your personal brand.

being genuine, being findable, and being bold.

the more I try to hide portions of my personal identity from my public persona, the more time I lose.

there’s a lot of privilege involved in being able to integrate your public and private personas.

If You Say You Can Do It, Show You Can Do It

There is a conflict, however, when women understate their performance and achievements and men overstate theirs.

keep updating your résumé every month.

Ask yourself what you are stopping yourself from being because you think you’ll never be done becoming.

many times, it’s fine for me to be doing my own thing or building my own team and that I don’t have to always fit in with someone else’s concept of what a job and a career is like.

“Never get involved in a set of fast-loop replies with someone on the Internet. It teaches them that they’re important and you have nothing better to do with your time.”

when you have even a modicum of information, start sharing it with others.

asking for specific help in that person’s skill set is likely to get you a response.

Start by working with the person you want to be mentored by, and let the relationship turn more organically into the one you want.

“transactional mentorship,” in which a mentor helps a mentee achieve a goal, and the mentee might one day repay the favor if ever in a position to. This is not mentorship. This is someone more junior using someone more senior under the guise of mentorship and trading on what should have been a long-term relationship to get a job or money.

Make it easy for your mentors to help you.

If a mentoring relationship in your life isn’t working out or never got started to begin with, let it trail away and die quietly so you can focus on what does help you.

same social forces that stop women from thinking that they’ll be a good fit in technology also contribute to them thinking that their experience is not as worthwhile as others’ when it comes to providing advice to new people in the field.

the only thing that you need to mentor people is to know one more thing than they know.

fear stops most people from striving for what they really want.

great majority of jobs come from personal connections.

Maintaining your professional network is realistically the only way that you will find new jobs.

Stop thinking of maintaining your professional network as socializing, and start thinking of it as part of your job. Your job does not merely consist of keeping your current job. In this economy, your job is (1) keeping your current job, (2) keeping your skills more current than is necessary for the job you are in and preferably ahead of the market as well, and (3) keeping your network ready for an onslaught of job request emails.

Add ten hours a week to your current job, and start thinking of that time as nonoptional professional development time. Use three-quarters of that time to improve your current set of skills by working on projects or your side gig, or taking classes. Use the remaining quarter to build your network.

Developing your blog or social media presence can help; introverts can really shine on social media.

while you are actively job hunting and growing your network, you need to attend three networking events or meetups on a monthly basis.

Simply stop spending time on someone who hasn’t responded to three or more of your posts or attempts at contact and assistance.

anyone who is indiscriminately taking your time does not need to get more of it.

The first is following up after your initial meeting.

The best possible way to get the attention of a mentor is to ask for help or an opinion.

The second and most important part of network maintenance is ongoing communication.

Pick at least one method of touching base at least once a year and keep up with it. Several ways that will work include (1) monitoring your LinkedIn feed for positive changes in your colleagues’ and connections’ job status (be careful not to congratulate someone over a lateral “promotion” or an involuntary change in employment), (2) collecting the birthdays of all your Facebook friends and using something like Google Calendar to remind you to send a quick happy birthday message to an acquaintance, (3) keeping a list of the MVPs in your network and tweeting them occasionally with fun information or a question about the restaurants in their area, (4) asking for the opinion of someone with whom you have not spoken in some time on a current issue or code problem, and (5) most importantly, when you see a gig that would suit the talents of someone you know, bring it to that person’s attention and, if you have the power to do so, offer to pass a résumé along to the hiring manager.

The third way you should be keeping up with your network is by thanking people when they’ve done something nice for you.

Serve your community. It will return the favor.

you cannot always control the world you live in, but you can inspire others through your service to them.

Humility is an especially hard lesson for me to learn. As a female engineer, I’ve been screaming for my entire career that I’m right, that my code is good enough, that my solution works, and that I belong in this room with the rest of the engineers. I’ve had to shift my approach a lot. Now what matters is that the people who I’m talking with feel as though they’re heard, not that I’m smart.

People who are habitually punctual usually have a whole lot of other life skills nailed down. They manage their time well. They’re honest with themselves about how long tasks will take. They have the logistics of their city and transport down. They respect you and your time. They have built time into their day for small tasks, often after they’ve arrived early to meetings. They likely sleep and eat on a healthier schedule. Sometimes you cannot help being late. There’s a difference, however, between someone whose definition of “on time” is five minutes late and who arrives more than fifteen minutes late half the time, and a person who arrives early or on time nineteen out of twenty times. Habitually late people are not honest with themselves about their commitments and how long their daily tasks will take to execute—or they’re pushovers about letting others dictate their schedule.

Develop your personality and interests outside technology.

We know the insidious, vicious effects of impostor syndrome. I won’t pretend that I don’t feel the impulse to soften my speech, to not intimidate the people to whom I’m speaking every once in a while.

Don’t push your authority and power away. It doesn’t “soften your image.” It makes you powerless and ineffectual.

Not knowing what to do next is a side effect of living an exciting life where you can have a real impact on people who, if in your place, would have equally no idea what to do next. It is not a symptom of being stupid or of having poor leadership abilities. If you don’t know what else to do, change the narrative.

The truth is that the reason you’re forming your own company is to give yourself the ability to have a job even if no other company will hire you.

Worry instead about two things: talking to your users to find out what they want and iterating your working product as rapidly as possible. To repeat: stop worrying about equity and who’s going to have what title and intellectual property protection, and worry about user feedback and iterating working product.

Start a company with someone who you think works as hard or harder than you, whose skills complement yours, and who has excellent communication habits.

Though one of you will be better than the other at certain tasks, that does not mean you should specialize to the extent of an incapacity to do most of the other person’s job. Your skill set must be complementary, not mutually exclusive.

You have my permission to whine about the pressures of your position in the startup. You never have my permission to complain about the level of effort that the other person is putting into your startup.

Do not schedule your work. Schedule your free time and activities. Do not touch work during your free time.

Schedule and maintain at least one mental hobby and at least one physical hobby.

startups are the only real way for a woman to get power in tech, at least right now.

No one ever gets rich (in the Western world’s definition of that word) working as a corporate drone.

There is a price to success, and constant criticism from others is that price.

Until a good work history has been redefined as one in which gaps for caretaking are seen as evidence of reliable and admirable commitment to family and nonnegative, it unfortunately falls to women to learn to project the confidence and communication that will make tech hiring managers believe that they’ll be good hires.

you do neither yourself nor the women with whom you work any favors by accepting low-quality work from a woman who is experiencing pressures from family life. Drop the amount of work but never lower your expectations of the quality.

No one trains managers in empathy.

The worst managers are the ones who assume a peer relationship with their team and take absolutely no responsibility for the success and comfort of the people they’ve been charged with protecting and promoting. “It’s not my fault; I didn’t know that poster would make her uncomfortable, and if it did, why didn’t she tell me?” Don’t blame your employees for not doing your job for you.

If you have a team member who is disabled and you plan an after-party at a rooftop bar with no elevator, you won’t hear from that person about your poor choice to create an “optional” event that your workers are expected to attend for job and networking reasons.

if they complain, they’re a party killer instead of a friend and colleague.

Hear what people aren’t saying.

Don’t think you know better than someone who’s been managing a disability for years. Let people make their own choices, and find a different way to accomplish your goals.
