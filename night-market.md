This is our first year trying this out so we would love some enthusiastic and flexible participants who are willing to work with us and give feedback so we can grow and learn together.

If you have been to Fur Squared before, the Night Market will occupy the same space as the Artist Alley, during the evenings when the Artist Alley is closed. Thus there will be a nightly set-up and tear-down. The Night Market will run Friday and Saturday night, specific times TBD but we are anticipating a 3 or 4 hour window during which the Night Market will be open to attendees for purchases, with one hour of set-up and tear-down time each. You will be able to tear-down early if you want to.

Art depicting illegal content will not be allowed. We recommend that anything considered “extreme” or otherwise potentially dangerously triggering, be kept in a binder (or otherwise out of plain sight) with content warnings (for example: extreme gore, non-consent, etc.). However, the entire room itself will be 18+, so in general your wares do not need to be hidden from plain view.
