Here are some things you can do to get involved with TX-10 Indivisible: 

* Before you do anything else, please read [The Indivisible
Guide](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/download-the-guide). That's
the playbook we're following. For instance, as the guide explains,
we have no ability with Trump and this Congress to advocate good
policies -- so we aren't even trying. Instead, we are completely
focused on stopping their bad policies and containing the damage
they could do to our country.

* Let us know you are interested. Fill out [this interest
form](/coming-soon). That way we'll know how to plug you in to the
movement. We'll also add you to our low-volume (no spam) annoucements
email list.

* Take action! We will send you action alerts with steps you can take.

* Join with and chat with other participants in the [TX-10 Indivisible
Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/381205945554014/). There
is a lot of chat and discussion there, as well as links to items of
interesst.  It's a closed group, so visit that address and request
a membership.

* Finally, we organize our work through an online message system called
Slack.  If you want to help with planning and organizing, [contact our admin team](mailto:info@tx10indivisible.us)
and request Slack access.
