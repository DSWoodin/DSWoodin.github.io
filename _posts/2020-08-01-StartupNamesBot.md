Thousands of startups are founded each year.
So as a public service I wrote a telegram bot to generate their names.

Note that you need to have the Telegram app installed in order to use the bot.
Click [here](https://lnkd.in/dF-6Wua) to open the bot.

The bot consists of a small backend server that was writtten in Python and is hosted on Heroku.

You can check out the git repo [here](https://github.com/eyalgolan/StartupNamesBot).
