 I agree. The idea that victimhood was a choice or a character flaw was rampant in Israel in the 50s. Holocaust survivors who thought they made it to a safe haven caught a ton of abuse from those who believed in the idea of the new Jew, who is stronger in body, in control of his own destiny and is able to defend themselves. Only when people were exposed to the testimonies in the trial of Adolf Eichmann did that start to change. People began to realize that European Jews didn't let themselves be led to the slaughter. They were targeted by an entire government hellbent on murdering them, and there wasn't anything they could do. True, there were some rebellions. Most notably Warsaw Ghetto. But that doesn't mean that everyone else was just weak. Living another day was an extreme act of bravery back there. Rebelling was an impossible feat. And not being slaughtered shouldn't require any kind of bravery - it should be a given.

In current day Israel the phrase "as sheep to the slaughter" is very touchy and most people would be careful not to apply it to holocaust victims. It took us a while to get here, and while I admire anyone who stood up to the Nazis, I wouldn't like to see us roll back to believing they were better and more deserving to live.

I hope once we fully internalize this we can apply the same to victims of diseases. I've seen terminology like "fighting cancer" popping up a lot in the last few days regarding the actor Chadwick Boseman. This phrase really starts to get on my nerves. I lost a family member to cancer this year. I don't believe she lost a fight. I believe she was sick, and her body couldn't overcome it, and the doctors couldn't either. And it has nothing to do with how resilient she was or how much fighting power she had. We want to believe that we can control our fates, that our behavior and our thoughts can stop us from being the next victim. But we can't. People just die, through no fault of their own. It can happen to the strongest of us. We need to accept it.
