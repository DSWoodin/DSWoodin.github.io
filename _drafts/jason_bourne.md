 And most importantly, read this book. This will help you the most. I know the author and he is a real life Jason Bourne.
 
 
 [Repobrate](http://tao-of-violence.weebly.com/reprobate.html) the first novel in the Amsterdam Assassin Series by Martyn V Halm.
 
 Here how the author did his research (it sounds like Hitman videogame is turned into a book) - *https://www.quora.com/Are-there-famous-female-hitmen/answer/Martyn-V-Halm?ch=10&share=ba4fc36b&srid=uqI0z*
 
     Podcast: Everyday Espionage. This one is pretty good so far, although from what I can tell it mainly focuses on the most practical stuff for everyday life. It doesn't tackle as much of the more life or death stuff that I mentioned.
     Spycast
     
     
          
     Book: "How to Become a Spy: A Guide to Developing Spy Skills and Joining the Elite Underworld of Secret Agents and Spy Operatives". This would be the ideal resource for me. However, judging by the reviews, it doesn't go into detail enough. Many people said it was too superficial and obvious.
     
     100 Deadly Skills. Written by a Navy SEAL who also did work for the NSA.
     
      1944 OSS Simple Sabotage Field Manual.
      
      Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life: A Former CIA Officer Reveals Safety and Survival Techniques to Keep You and Your Family Protected
