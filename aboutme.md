I am currently leading the Risk Data team at Ramp. Our team builds the core ML models and data products that power Risk Management at Ramp. Prior to joining Ramp, I worked as a Data Scientist Meta on their Ads Core ML team. Before that, I completed my Economics PhD at New York University. My academic research interests were primarily focused on industrial organization, applied econometrics and behavioral economics. Outside of work, I like to code, play around with interesting datasets, bike around, and spend time with my dog and partner.
