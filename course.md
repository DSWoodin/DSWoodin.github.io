## Reviews

> Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms was an amazing experience! I loved the units; each was something that I needed to dig into more as I work to simplify my life and home. The layout for this course was perfect, giving time and space to work on each subject before moving on. I love that I can go back and work through the ones that are more challenging for my household. Kellyâ€™s support and encouragement to tackle things one small bit at a time was just what I needed! I will definitely recommend this course to my friends who are looking to make changes in their lives to simplify. - Deanna

> I have to say I love how simply laid out your course is! I love the units lay out and overall how great this has been . The printable sheets are so helpful I have my own little booklet of all of them now. - Terri

> I really enjoyed Kellyâ€™s course! I think itâ€™s perfect for busy moms trying to find ways to organize their home, create systems and better routines! My favorite module was the time management lesson! But every module gives practical and easy to follow tools to better your home life! Such a great course! - Shelly

> Kellyâ€™s course is truly amazing and life changing. She teaches you how to simplify your busy mom life and I love that I can work at my own pace. Itâ€™s not rushed at all. You get to be part of a community of other moms on the same journey as you are and working on the same steps! If anyone could guide you to living slow Kelly is definitely it! Sheâ€™s also the mama that has helped me so much in simplifying our homeschool too and I canâ€™t thank her enough! - Jessica

### About me

Hi, I'm Kelly! Iâ€™m a mother of four children - three boys, one toddler girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. Iâ€™m a past elementary teacher, turned stay at home, work at home mom eight years ago after I had my second child. Iâ€™ve found that the busier Iâ€™ve become and as my children age, that itâ€™s become even more important to figure out what is most important to me and us as a family. Living a simpler lifestyle has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, and stronger connections with my people. It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of my home and life. I enjoy helping busy moms simplify home life by teaching flexible planning methods and skills. Listen more about my take on simplifying things at home on a podcast I was interviewed on [here](https://www.stitcher.com/show/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/episode/keeping-it-simple-an-interview-with-kelly-79787253).
