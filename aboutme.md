 *Excited about the future of engineering*
</div>


My name is Panteleimon Angelidis. During my high school years, I was an active student finding myself involved in various activities, such as volunteerism, competitions and theatre. I always felt an inclination in Mathematics, participating in competitions and excelling in the class exams. 

Since 2018 I've been studying Finance and Accounting majoring Finance at the University of Macedonia, with the distinction of the 4th highest grade in the entrance year. In my experience as student, I participated in business organizations, sport competitions and did personal research. I've been a part of a valuations company as an Assistant Equity Researcher and contributed to 2 valuation papers, analyzing a conglomerate-financial institution.

I am not a fun of traditional approaches of Finance, rather excited about the fintech future.

As a part of the CVML Laboratory of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, my experience extends to various Python libraries, such as Pytorch (running in Cuda) and Sklearn.
