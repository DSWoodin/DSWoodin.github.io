 fucking THIS.

People need support because they're *grieving.* Repression does not in anyway help anyoneâ€”not the dumper, dumpee, nobody. People must process what happened. Relationships are the single most important things to human beings, always, of all kinds. Losing them is devastating, even if it doesn't make us "Feel" sad or bad, and one way or another our minds need to process it.

That being said, a short relationship *also* is a loss and should not be discounted. Time does not really mean much, and each relationship, as long as it was important to anyone, deserves to be mourned and requires both participants to grieve.
