I was raised in Lexington, Massachusetts and developed a strong affinity for strategy games and analytic solutions to interesting problems. In grade school, I spent a lot of time in competitive math which formulated a very structured and rigorous thinking process in terms of understanding various problems. During high school, I spent most of my time in competitive debate which helped my logical reasoning and research skills while also forming my interest in complex problems with a lot of moving pieces. 

When I first entered Northwestern University, I thought I'd study economics and political science, but after taking my first computer science course, I realized the power of both analytical and computational strategies. My curiosity led me down a journey to better understand computers and AI, so that I could harness them to solve various problems.

As a result, I'm actively looking for unique problem areas where I can further apply my skills and learn.
