# Speedruns

We’ve put together an [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUqgl9orGGfwwoQvUAWMO7MQ6dVPc4Hd-BiMGv2DdAux7xkA/viewform) for people interested in doing speedruns. There isn’t a hard deadline for filling this out, but the sooner, the more likely we’ll be able to get it on the schedule and plan for it to be a smoother experience.
