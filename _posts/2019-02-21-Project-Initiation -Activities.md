Project initiation mainly involves eliciting requirements to understand the scope of a potential solution. Elicitation days are fun and many business analysts enjoy elicitation days the most. These days occur early in the project or possibly even before the project starts and involve meeting with stakeholders to understand what they want to achieve in a project. 

**Pre-Project Activities**

# Understanding Business Objective

To identify the business goals, needs, requirements of the organization, project, or stakeholder. The first project as a Business Analyst. And failed with Embarrassment. Because you developed a solution that does not meet the Objective, Goal, and Purpose of the project. 
You may develop a great product but still failed this project cause it does not meet the goal set for the project. As a business analyst, this is heartbreaking.

## Three (03) Questions to ask yourself 
 1. What is the purpose of the project --- Why approve this project, Why we are budgeting this project? 
 2. What are the goals and objectives of this project --- What is the return on investment, What are the main critical pieces and components? 
 3. In the eyes of this project, what is a success, and how will it be measured --- Measurement matrix?

Once you have those details, you start working through and eliciting requirements. Yeah, there is going to be a lot of other features, and other enhancement that they may want as part of the project, but your number one goal should be to solve the problem that the project is intended to solve.

Creating a product that does not solve the project wastes tons of time and money and it, quite frankly, is extremely embarrassing, is just what every business analyst has gone through.

## What is a Business Case?

A decision-making tool is used to determine the effects a particular decision will have on profitability.

Ultimately, what that means is it's a document that's presented to decision-makers and it's giving them options and telling them 'OK, based on these certain actions, here's the cost-benefit ratio, here's the return on investment by making a decision one way or another.

## Why it is used?

A business case is used to identify and highlight problems or opportunities that a business can take. And then the different options they have and the recommended solution by the person that's creating the business case.
Ultimately, it's the driver of projects. Many companies will start projects solely from business cases that are written. So they make their employees write business cases and that gets put in front of a decision-making committee, a person, a group where they're saying 'OK, here's all the business cases now, on what ones make sense.

Why is a business case used, is really used to convince decision-makers of a certain course of action? So, a business case is done to identify the problem, layout potential solutions and their cost and their benefits, but the big thing is the recommendation, right, that person is driving and saying 'here is what we should be doing and here's how we should be solving this problem and we should be taking action to do that, and here's why so it's kind of almost a sales technique to sell the business and investing money into solving that particular problem or working towards achieving that particular opportunity.

## When it is Used?

When Business Case is used, I want to make sure I covered two things here. Number one, a business case is really done on almost all projects. The only difference is whether it is written or not. A business case is a kind of how you work through if you are going to move forward on something, you work through that decision process.

First of all,  'OK, what are we trying to solve?'. OK. Next up,
What are the different solutions that we could potentially use to solve that problem?'
What's the return on investment?
What's the cost?
What's the benefit to be able to do that?
And then, What's the recommended solution?

And, so most of us do that in our head as we're working through and deciding if we should be moving forward on a course of action. But a business case is a formal document that's done because that document that's being created by a person that's not making the decision ultimately, so they're creating that document to sell the decision-maker on you know moving forward, one, taking some action and then two, taking action in the recommended way they want.
The second thing is this is kind of obvious and I've talked about it a little bit already is the business case is done prior to a project. So there's no point in doing a business case after you are working on the project because the business is already investing in that particular project, but it's done early on usually to get funding, to get budget, to move forward, and actually kick off and square up a project to actually move forward and solve for that. So that's when it's done, that's when a business case is used.

## Who creates a business case?
Well, it's different per company and per industry and really per project sometimes and different companies will have certain departments or projects that need a business case, other times they don't. But in regards to who creates it, it can be a lot of different people. The most common people I see created are our business executives, so those are you know upper-level management. This could be VPs, this could be directors so people that have managers or above reporting to them, then you have the business manager, so this is a person that leads a team.
They can be creating the business case or it could be a business analyst and there are times, there are roles of business analyst where they're located more on the business side of things. And that's what they do. They're driving forward business cases to then, you know, sell the business and making the improvement or solving the problem, and then that business analyst works that project through to completion.
So the kind of who, in this case, for this particular lecture, we're going to assume that we're creating the business case or at least we're helping create the business case, so that we understand writing.

# 5 Phases of Creating an Effective Business Case

1.  Initial Analysis
2.  Determining Potential Solution
3.  Write the Business Case
4.  Review Business Case
5.  Present the Business Case

Initial Analysis, Phase
So there's really five phases to an effective business case and these are the five phases that I follow as I create one. The first thing is an initial analysis. So you need to understand what that problem is and really work through of been able to figure out all those different pieces.

The second thing is determining the potential solutions to the problem. So not just looking at 'OK, well here's what I want, here's the way I want to go', you got to look at 'OK, what are all the, you know, objective look, what are all the possible options that we could utilize?'.

Third thing is actually writing the business case. So that's actually pretty far down. You've done a lot of work. By the time you're writing the business case, a lot of times you're just putting that into a document and then I'm going back and filling in the gaps.

Fourth thing is reviewing the business case, making sure it's good, you don't have any mistakes and kind of in doing all that.

And then the fifth thing, the final step there is presenting that business case. The whole goal of the business case and presenting the business case is to get the business to say 'yes, we agree and we want to move forward with that recommendation or that project'.

So those are the five phases that I utilize on creating an effective business case.

So now what we're going to do is actually go through each of those phases and further break it down and give you some kind of highlights of things that happened during that particular phase. So first off phase one, the initial analysis. This is where you're really diving in and fully understanding the problem or opportunity. So you need to fully understand it, you need to understand that's the root problem and you need to define who it's all affecting, right, and kind of working through and detailing all the pieces to that problem because you want your recommended solution to be able to solve for all pieces of that, not just one, you know, kind of final or one little piece of the problem.

The second thing is under the initial analysis you need to determine some high level requirements, you want to get an idea of what the business requirements are and this isn't a full, you know, business requirements documents or anything like that, but this is just some high level requirements, get an idea of kind of what their business need is and you'll be able to determine that through out kind of understanding that problem most of the time with just a few additional questions.

The third thing is, you want to understand what data you're going to need to sell this idea and sell the return on investment. The first thing the business case needs to be able to do is to convince decision makers to take action. That's number one, regardless of the action. You just want to convince them to take action, convince them that a problem is there and that they need to take action. And the second thing is to convince them to go towards your recommended solution. So you want to identify and get information or understand where you can get information to help determine that. So maybe that's in, you know, maybe the issue is that the customer service team is solving their cases way too slow. Right.

They're solving their cases within 72 hours. But as part of the business, you have kind of a motto that you go by that you'll have their customers case solved within 48 hours and you're not really hitting that mark. And so now you're going in to identify what is causing that. What is the problem? And so now you need to look at and say 'OK, now I need to identify data to help support that, I need to help, I need to identify that the data that supports that it's taking 72 hours and identifying what data could be collected laying around to validate that the particular solution is actually meeting the need that is being driven', you know, from that, from the project.

The next thing is you want to, after you've got a good understanding of the problem, you get some high level requirements and you understood kind of how you're going to support your project and what data you're going to need to define that return on investment.

The next thing is you want to validate with some decision makers that the level return is worth the potential investments. Before you actually waste time creating a business case you want to make sure it even makes sense to go past this point. Some people will skip this step and go and create a business case and then they'll go to present it and their boss will say 'oh, we already know about that problem and there's a solution that's being created over here' or 'we've already determined that solving that solution is going to cost more than the benefit we're going to get'. That's not good. Then you just wasted all this time creating a business case.
I had one very real example of that when I was working as a business analyst. The business wanted me to automate this process that they did and I'm trying to remember exactly what the process was, but it was a process that they were doing. And there were two users that had to do it once a week and the process that they had to follow was a little bit more of a manual process. They've got a pop up alert that they needed to do it and then they had to click a series of like three buttons and select one option set. And it took on average when I timed it out about nine seconds, for these users to do this once a week.
And so what I was able to do is say 'OK, how much time does that take them in a year?'. You know, two users every week nine seconds, round that up and say 'OK, maybe it takes 10 seconds because there can be a couple times where they're a little slower or for whatever reason or maybe the system is a little slower' and then you can figure out 'OK, it takes them a total of an hour'. Let's just say, I'm not doing the math, but it takes them an hour every year to work through this manual process. And when we looked at potential solutions, the solution that was most evident there were really two solutions one was do nothing and the other solution was to automate the process. Automating the process was going to take us around 52 hours to develop, we wouldn't see a return on investment, we won't even break even for 52 years.
So at that point, there's no point in moving forward. I didn't have to write a business case or do anything for it because it's like well, there's no reason for us to move forward. So that's really what you're doing here, just validating what some decision makers that it doesn't even make sense to move. The next thing is you're going to do an internal thing like I did at that point and I did some analysis to determine does it even make sense to move forward. Is this ever going to get approved? And in this particular case it wasn't. So I just canceled it.

So you just want to do what I call a sanity check and just validate that even make sense to move forward from there. So once you're complete with phase 1 you move into phase 2 which is where you're actually determining potential solutions. So the potential solutions, you want to determine all of the potential solutions, you don't want to leave out any solutions. You want to look and objectively look and say 'here are the possible ways we could solve for this' and kind of one key at the bottom that I have there is and I had in my example is one potential solution should be that you do nothing. Right. It could be that one action is to take no action and because there is a cost to taking no action, so you want to have that is a potential solution for the project because that is a very real thing. The only way that wouldn't be the case is if maybe a government agency is driving it and saying you know what. Actually no, it still would be so. What I was thinking is a government agency is driving and saying for regulations you must meet this particular requirement. But I guess you still could have a solution to say that there's no action taking and that maybe the fines you would receive are less and would actually take to resolve the problem.

But besides the point, you want to identify all the possible solutions to the problem and you don't want to just, you know, have high level them, you want to understand what the benefits are of that particular solution, what the costs are for that particular solution, the timetable of the project. You don't need the schedule, we use what I understand is: are we talking a couple hours, a couple days, weeks, months, years to create that and kind of understanding that you're talking bleeding edge technology that timetable's going to be pretty long, right, because you have to research and development to determine that.

So give me an idea of timetable, then the next thing is time before return on investment is realized.
So for that example, it would have taken us 53 years to break even before we even made back our investment on that. And we all know our system is not going to last 53 years so we probably moved that system in a number of years and we never would have made our return on that particular issue. And then the risks and the risks you want to identify are the risks of that particular project. So maybe you could, maybe your system is not very well defined and you could break a whole bunch of other stuff rate, so the timetable is really short and the costs are really low for it, but the risks are really high that when we make this change we don't know exactly what the back end is doing anymore. And so it could break a bunch of stuff. So you want to make sure that that's defined. So this benefits, cost, timetable, time for return on investment and risks should be done for every single solution that you've come up with including your recommended solution.

Then you move into phase 3 where you actually start writing the business case. Most companies have a template that you use for their company as some are a little bit more formal, some are a little less formal, but they all have the same general concept, so the six sections to a business case and I will talk about our list right here.

So the first thing is the executive summary. This is actually the thing that I write last, what the executive summary is doing is saying okay for executives that don't have time to read this whole document which could be many pages, here's a summary of everything. Right. Here's a summary very high level about the problem. Here's a summary about the kind of quick analysis that was done. Here's a summary of the potential solutions and the recommended solution. Right. And it's just summarized in a couple of paragraphs. The whole point of that is executives are not going to have time to read the whole document. They need a bird's eye view to understand the high levels of it to usually prepare themselves for coming in to the presentation of that business case and deciding if they want to move forward. So the executive summary is the thing at the top of the document, but that's usually the last thing that's done.

Next thing is the problem statement. So this is the well-defined problem statement as to the opportunity or issue that we're having that we're solving for and this should be very succinct and very clear. No ambiguity.

Next is the analysis that you did, you have some documentation there as to what you did and what you were looking at and how it went and what you found. Then you go into your solution options and so this should be listing out those potential options.

I have the cost-benefit analysis afterwards, sometimes that's rolled in and they want that on like I had mentioned in phase 2 on each solution. Sometimes they want each solution and then they want some type of matrix, matrix or matrices that has OK, solution and here's the cost, the benefits and here's where we would get our return on investment. There are some different forms that people use and different companies use. So they all have that, but it's just a matter of it's as if it's own section or if it's rolled up into the solution options section.

And then last but not least is the recommendation. This is what are you recommending and here's everything the problem, potential solutions. I've done other research and here's what I recommend we move forward with. So that's how you write the business case.

So next thing you're going to do is review the business case. This is just like a resume. You want to make sure that this is, that this is good and solid, otherwise your hard work on this may go to waste. So you want to go back through your business case and you want to validate that that problem statement justifies a call to action, ultimately, that's number one. Right. You want those decision makers to say 'yes, we need to take action'. So you want to make sure that you're portraying that problem very strongly and backing it up with facts and with numbers. Second thing is you want to ensure that all the valid solutions are given. You don't want to leave a solution out or a potential solution out because it maybe competes with your recommended solution. You want to make sure that's listed, you want to let that business make the decision with all the facts. The third thing is double check your cost-benefit analysis calculations. It's really easy to get those mixed up and that can really throw everything off and if somebody points out a mistake in your presentation your credibility is shot. So you want to make sure that that's accurate. Fourth is you want to objectively dissect your recommendation. So after you get all done with all your solutions, take a step back and really objectively look at it. Don't just go with that option because that option sounds like the coolest option and just a project you really love to run because that's an area that you want to get into because you want it to be right for the business, so make sure you're objectively dissecting your recommendation. Obviously correct any grammatical or spelling mistakes and then you want to have another person review it. So just another set of eyes on it, you've been looking at it for how many days, maybe a week or two, three weeks. So you want to have somebody else review it. And then last but not least is you want to get buy-in of two key stakeholders. So this doesn't have to be the decision makers, you want this to be stakeholders like, usually if you're offering up a project you've got a business manager or somebody that that really wants that project to go on and that's one of the problem people, one of the people that are dealing with the problem on day to day basis or could be users that are dealing with it. You want to get a couple of people that back you up and that have reviewed the business case and they agree with it because that's going to give you a lot of credibility when you go in to actually presenting the business case to the executives or the decision makers.

After you've reviewed it, we have the fifth and final stage and that's actually presenting the business case. So the first thing you want to do is you want to remind yourself that they haven't seen this before so you might have sent the business case to them prior to the meeting as part of the invite which is a good habit to get into, at least they can review it if they have a little time, but you want to go in as if they've never seen this. they have no idea what the problem is, they have no idea what the possible solutions are. Because you've been working on it forever it's really easy for you to skip the high level and just dive right into the details and lose people. And if they're lost, there's no way that you're going to get their agreement for funding of moving the project forward. With that same concept, you want to make sure that in that meeting you are hammering home and defining that problem and the need for that business to act, just like you want your business case to state that's the first thing. If decision makers don't see that there's a problem they're not going to really listen to your solutions and recommendations because they're going to say 'you know what, it's not that big of a problem, who cares, we're not going to take action'. Right. So you want to make sure that you're hammering that home and that you're kind of selling them that there's a problem. Next thing is give your recommendation. You don't need to go through everything you want to, you know, talk about that, talk about the problem and then give your recommendation and then you can talk about the return on investment for that particular recommendation.

You then, I like to then circle back and say 'here are the other options that were being looked at and here's the other solutions that we came up with and here are the reasons I ruled each of them out' or 'here are the reasons that I went with my recommended solution over that particular solution'. So it just helps people to kind of rule out the other ones. And sometimes it's really obvious, but it just helps to kind of break that down. The next thing is you want to touch on each risk. So if there's a risk. Touch on it. You don't want a deep dive and spend too much time into the risks that are there. You just want to make sure that they're aware that there's a risk. And if they have questions, I guarantee you, they will stop and they will ask you to go deeper into that risk. So just make sure you're touching on it, not that you're skating past it, but you're addressing it, touching it and then moving on, only coming back if they ask you for more details. You also to build your credibility, you want to mention your stakeholder backers. So those two people that you had reviewed ahead of time that agreed with you that this is a problem and needs to be solved and that the solution that you've come up with is a good one. Bring them up. You know 'hey, the business manager, Bob, is somebody that I've reviewed this business case with and he was heavily involved in helping me come up with the solutions'. He really agrees with this, that this is a problem and this solution will solve it for them and it's going to make business a lot easier for them and you can kind of mentioned it. So it's building on your credibility especially if you're having like subject matter experts or people that are kind of proponents within that business that help drive change, positive change, then you know, mentioning them will be very helpful because it's going to help those decision makers say 'you know what, if Bob thinks it's the right thing to do, it's his department and he's backed some of the other business cases that went really well and we're, you know, kind of got good return on investment'. And then the last thing you want to do is you want to close the presentation summarizing the benefits and the return on investment for the recommendation and the action that you've kind of come up with.

So you want to end with saying, you know, this is really important, this is going to help solve that problem that we've defined. And here's the benefits, here's when we get our return, you know, we get our return on investment within two months and then everything after that is profit, we think within the next, within the first year, it's going to equate to X amount of dollars and saved whatever, saved cost. And then five years here is kind of where it would be. And so you want to make sure that you're ending with those benefits and that return on investment. So really that's the overall thing about, you know, the basics of a business case and then the five phases that I've kind of come up with that you work through as you're writing and presenting a business case. I hope that makes sense. I hope that will help you as you move forward if you ever get pulled in to help or to write a business.

# What is a Stakeholder and How to Identify Them

Project Stakeholders are the people that are affected by the project either directly or indirectly. Stakeholders can be following types: 1. Project Team Members 2. Customer 3. Suppliers 4. City/ Community 5. Professional Organization 6. Any Individual Impacted by the Project 7. Any Individual to Support the Project
Anyone has a positive or negative impact to this project.

# # Why Identify Stakeholders?

• It increase the chances for success
• Additional ideas
• Varied perspectives
• Gains buy-in
• Increase credibility

## How to Identify Stakeholders to a Project?

• Walk through anticipated scope/ process.
○ Beneficiaries of the effort
○ Direct involved with the beneficiaries of the effort
○ Jobs that may be affected by project or results
○ Government Officials
○ Influencers
○ Interest in Outcome
• Get Ideas from stakeholders as you identify them.

## Assigning Stakeholders Responsibility using RACI Matrix

It’s a good habit to assign the responsibility right away. The way most of the people like to use RACI Matrix

RACI Matrix: Why is it used?
• Critical tool to understand and align the responsibilities of stakeholders. It’s a good thing to know who has the what responsibility at the beginning of your project.
• Alleviates power struggles
• Reduces lack of ownership
• Sets clear expectations!
• No your roles

Responsibility:
• Who is/will be doing this task?
• Who is assigned to work on this task?
Accountable:
• Who’s head will roll if this goes wrong?
• Who has the authority to sign off the work?
Consulted:
• Who can tell me more about this task?
• Who are the Subject Matter Experts?
Informed:
• Who’s work depends on this task?
• Who has to be kept update about the progress?
