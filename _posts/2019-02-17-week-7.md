Hello reader!

Now for our first post. This is about week 7. My project group decided to use this week on information gathering. We all have different areas we would like to focus on, and therefore this week will mainly contain alot of information I have gathered around my two areas.

The format for these posts will be like a weekly diary, which will contain a short summary of each day. Finally I will push the post when the week ends, so everyone can access it through my website.

**Monday the 2019-02-11:**

This day we met up to start our journey to be even better software developers, and prepare our first project focused meeting with Ordbogen.com, our Product Owner.

For nearly two hours we brainstormed and came up with some questions, so we can create an equal footing with Ordbogen.com around what this project really is about, and what requirements they have.

Underneath you can see a picture of the brainstorm:
