## About convenience and automation 

I love that Azure has the capability to start and stop my Virtual Machines on a schedule using DevTestLabs. There are some great use cases of DevTestLabs for [developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-developer-lab) and some great use cases for [training](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-training-lab)

DevTestLabs has some great features but as an automation advocate I had a new requirement:

> As a user I want a button on my mobile to turn on a VM for 4 hours and it auto shuts down so that I can do some work and then the VM is turned off automatically

What could I use to meet this requirement? I had played around with [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) a little and figured out I could make buttons on the homepage of my Android phone.

Here are the tasks I decided were involved:
1. Find Azure connector for flow
1. Add task in Flow to Start Azure VM
1. Wait for x hours
1. Add task in Flow to Stop and deallocate Azure VM

It all sounded plausable and I thought this would be easy since I found the [ARM connector for flow](#)

I hit an issue where I got blocked by the authentication in Azure with an error access token is from the wrong issuer:

I figure this is something to do with the way flow integrates with Live ID rather than an Azure AD tenant so I decided to try an Azure Service Principal.

##To create a service principal
There is a step by step guide for [creating a new service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal) in Azure.

Be sure to retain the password (key) which will be similar to _AAfBBQ5TADuc1dBn1Quqy3g4ABBT+fWzXT0ZYo=_

##To give your new service principal permissions to your VM
1. Open the Azure Portal
1. Find your virtual machine
1. Open Access Control (IAM)
1. Add "Virtual Machine Contributor" as shown below:

Next

##Initialise some variables
- VmShortResourceId e.g. *virtualMachines/v-stegg-win10*

- VmOnTimeMins e.g. *240*

- strDelayUntil - a calcuated time in the future by adding mins above 

##create new Flow with HTTP or button trigger - START
1. add connection using new principal

##add a delay

##create new Flow with HTTP or button trigger - DEALLOCATE

#add notifications before and after

##Next steps
1. add a physical iot button (bttn)
1. consider how to block kicking off the flow twice - Azure doesn't die if you start a VM which is running so it's not a big issue
1. add a bot to start this from Cortana e.g. *"Hey, Cortana... turn on my dev box for 4 hours"*
