 Another thing that also gets to me when we evaluate and discuss sports is how we tend to ignore the ones where women outperform men. I only recently learned that some women are outperforming men in ultra-endurance competitions, which reminded me and brought my attention to what we value not only in sports but overall in most societies. We often value brute strength over strategy, combat over collaboration, speed over endurance, etc. Characteristics that we've associated as "masculine" are seen as better than the ones we've associated with "feminine" ones, which, obviously, is definitely not a novice theory in feminism. 

Yet, even as someone who keeps herself well informed in feminist discourse, I found myself wondering why I had never heard of this area in sports where women are, at times, outperforming and outshinning men.

Anyways, my ramblings aside, I've included three articles below on the success of women in ultra-endurance sports.
