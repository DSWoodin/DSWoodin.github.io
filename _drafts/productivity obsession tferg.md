# productivity obsession tferg

- Hello, my dudes, my name is Tiffany,

welcome back to my series,
"Internet Analysis,"

where I like to research
and discuss things

relevant to social issues and media.

Today's topic is our
productivity obsession.

- Productive daily habits.

- [Woman] To improve productivity.

- Working a little bit harder.

- Work ethic.

- Very hardworking.

- Kind of be productive.

- Secrets to my productivity.

- You've got to work for it.

- [Man] Being as productive as possible.

- So I've been wanting to
write this video for a while

but ironically, it took me a long time

to get motivated enough to do it.

In this video, I want to
discuss productivity in general

but I do have to address
the elephant in the room.

Obviously we are living
in this strange time,

this unprecedented time which
does affect productivity

and how we think of it.

And first I wanna give a shout out

to all of the healthcare workers,

all of the grocery store clerks,

all of the pharmacists, all the cashiers,

delivery workers, restaurant workers,

everyone who is working right now

and keeping society functioning is a hero.

Whether you are currently working

or are unemployed or are a student,

the idea of productivity
is relevant to everyone.

Typically we have schedules and plans,

but all of that has been
changed and interrupted.

So for once most of us have
to slow down, stay home,

now what?

On one hand you might feel like
this is a unique opportunity

to be super productive, you know?

Finally write that novel
you've been waiting to work on.

Or, do the thing you've
been putting off for years.

Many people have been
sharing the fact that

Shakespeare wrote King
Lear while quarantined.

Okay.

I'm not Shakespeare.

On the other hand,

this is a rare chance to actually take

a significant break.

Many people have spare time
that they're not used to having.

So between these two options

I feel like a lot of us
feel very conflicted.

Should we get a lot of work
done, or should we just chill?

So that's what I want
to explore in this video

and I also have a few other questions.

How do we strike a balance
between being productive

and relaxing,

taking a break,

giving ourselves the time and space to do

absolutely nothing?

And also,

why is productivity so important?

Why do we feel so
obligated to be productive

as often as possible?

So let's jump right in.

First I want to shout out

my hustle culture video.

I also discussed toxic
productivity and workaholism.

Very relevant.

So if you wanna watch that video

I would definitely recommend it.

But generally,

we love being busy

and we love being productive.

It is almost an addicting thing.

Certain figures are well known to be

icons of productivity.

Usually they are CEOS, millionaires,

or tech geniuses.

We, the peasants, look
to them as role models

and we hope to hear

their secrets to success.

What's your morning routine?

What's your daily schedule like?

How do you do it?

Many of these figures
will recommend things like

waking up super early,

planning out every minute of your day,

anything you can do for peak performance

and efficiency.

Silicon Valley bros also
give us tips such as

microdosing LSD.

Stimulated creativity

and makes you super
productive. Apparently.

Or extreme fasting /
disordered eating habits

that are disguised as "biohacking".

Or they do things like
only consume Soylent

for efficiency.

You have to limit decision fatigue

don't wast time thinking
about what to eat,

or even what to wear.

Turn yourself into a cartoon character

and just wear the same outfit every day.

Efficiency.

Steve Jobs did it,

Zuckerberg does it,

Obama does it.

All of these tips whether
they are useful or not

are designed to give you more time.

To work more. And by the way
quickly going back to the to

the whole "Secrets to Success" thing

I think that success in that
context largely means wealth,

basically, "How did you get rich?

And is there anything
I can do to do it too?"

If you believe in Ameritocricy

you would believe that the
person who works the hardest,

who is the most productive

is the most successful,

and their success will
be rewarded financially.

The reality is for many of us

we only feel good or valuable as people

when we are being productive.

And where does this come from?

(laughs)

Capitalism, baby!

(bells ringing)

I should ring a bell every time

I mention capitalism in a video.

Seriously though,

under capitalism,

"productivity" isn't just
about getting things done

or accomplishing your goals.

The labor of workers produces value.

Essentially the capitalist
owns the means of production,

and the workers are exploited

because the bosses have all the power

and the workers have
essentially no other choice.

They need to pay the bills.

Most workers could be easily replaced

so we feel disposable

and then we feel obligated to work harder,

work longer hours,

maybe hoping for a promotion or a raise.

But honestly bare minimum,

just trying not to get laid off.

We have to prove that we
are "valuable employees".

And that's why so many
workers feel actually guilty

for taking any time off

or even relaxing in their spare time,

having sick days,

because you're not working.

And it's been drilled into our minds:

When we are not being productive,

we are being being bad. We are worthless.

But really that is not true,

the idea that modern workers
are not being productive,

that we're all just distracted by SnapChat

and Instagram filters.

In the past, productivity

and wages used to be
loosely tied together,

but now,

and actually for decades,

that gap between the value
of things being produced

and what workers are being
compensated has been growing.

We as workers are actually more
productive than ever before

but we are not being
compensated to match that.

So, when you are underpaid
you are obligated to

either work more hours if you can,

or work a second job.

And then even at home,

maybe you have a hobby,

we are taught that our
hobbies should be monetized.

Nothing is worth doing
unless it makes you money.

Turn it into a side hustle, baby.

Oh that thing you enjoy
doing just for pleasure?

Make yourself resent it because now

you're obligated to use it
to help you pay the bills.

You think you're gonna escape the rat race

but it's actually driving
you deeper down into it.

Life of being a full time YouTuber.

Just kidding I love this job.

There's no pressure.

There's an old protestant value that

basically boils down to

wastes of time being a deadly sin.

So through religion and
a lot of different ways

these ideas are drilled into our minds,

it's in our culture,

don't waste time,

work more,

get things done.

- I have convinced myself that

if I'm not using all the
tools I have at my disposal,

to do the maximum amount of good

and like give people good jobs,

then I am less of a good person
than I otherwise could be.

And that's maybe a little
bit too much pressure.

Maybe not, but maybe.

Let me take a quick break
to explain something.

So there's productivity that I think of

in terms of getting work done,

like say, school work or work work

that you have to get done,

and then there's this
sense of accomplishment

that you get from finishing things.

So I think

you can get that sense of accomplishment

from doing things around the house

or doing things for fun

doing things that you enjoy.

But I do think that it gets complicated

when those two are kind
of all mixed together

and it's hard to separate
what you're doing

for yourself for your own sense of joy,

or purpose,

and tying your self worth
to like literally the number

of hours that you work at your job

because you feel like
that's all that defines you.

We'll talk about that
a little more later on

but basically we aspire
to be more productive

more efficient,

so a lot of us watch motivational content.

Like the millionaires and CEOS,

we get advice and motivation from

aspiring entrepreneurs,

successful people,

perfect students,

people who generally
have an image of success

and seem like they have
their shit together.

And in this kind of content
there is a big variety in tone,

there are some dudes who will yell at you

for being a lazy piece of shit,

tell you you should
sleep less and work more,

and there's some very nice, sweet people

who just want to help you be a better you.

Find your flavor, I guess.

On YouTube one very
popular genre right now is

kind of how-to-be-productive videos.

Study With Me contents,

there's also Clean With Me videos.

Any task, there's a video for it.

You can learn how to be more organized,

make to-do lists, make calendars,

color code things.

And I think one part of the appeal is that

it's just really calming

and relaxing to watch
people to satisfying things

like bullet journaling or cleaning.

The irony of watching a productive video

while you're laying in bed doing nothing.

We've all been there!

Generally I think this content is great

and super helpful,

I think it's awesome to learn new skills

or new strategies.

Like right now there are
a lot of videos going up

about how to work from home

because many of us are in this situation

and if you're not used to
studying or working from home

it can be a really hard adjustment.

So it is awesome to have videos like that

that can teach you actual practical tips

so that you can get stuff done
that you have to get done.

But, my big thing about
this type of content,

as motivating as it can be, is that,

I think people need to not
set unrealistic expectations

for themselves.

You're watching these people

and they're showing what works for them,

but you need to find what works for you

and don't compare the two.

Know yourself.

I know that my foot's asleep.

As always.

Depending on your energy level,

your workload, your lifestyle,

your personality,

these concepts may work
for you, wonderfully,

or be disastrous.

Wake up at 5AM, take a cold shower,

go to the gym, meditate, read a book,

all before going to work or school.

Mm, sounds great in theory,

but if I were to try and wake up at 5AM,

I would be taking a nap by 10,

and it would probably make my day worse.

So it's not a fit for me.

Now, should I wake up
a little bit earlier?

Yes, probably.

But it doesn't have to be 5AM.

Obviously self improvement is great

and necessary in a lot of circumstances.

Addressing your own bad habits is great,

but again do not beat yourself
up for not being these people

or, not being what these
people are putting out there

because of course it's
an idealized version

of their schedule or their work day.

Do not beat yourself for being imperfect

or not impeccably organized.

One of my biggest points of this video

is just kind of being kind to yourself

and adjusting your expectations

for yourself.

And I think we need to
give ourselves reminders

like, we do not exist just to work.

Even looking at language we
use terms like "efficiency"

and "peak performance" to describe people,

when really that encourages
us to be more like machines.

Deep. (laughs)

I recommend you listen to
Marina and the Diamonds song,

I Am Not a Robot.

It's a bop

and it's meaningful.

Especially right now but always,

if all you can do is
survive, then focus on that

and do that.

I totally get that.

There are some days when I
cannot bear to do anything

except get up, eat, and go back to sleep.

Is that productive?

No, but are you surviving

and you're an imperfect human

and you deserve to have
bad days or bad moments?

Yes.

Anti-productivity.

Quarantine has obviously been
a weird experience so far

for a lot of us.

It feels very, very
strange to stay at home

and have so much time,

that we don't know what
to do with ourselves.

And normally we tend to
feel guilty for doing things

like watching too much TV,

using our phones too much,

playing games too much.

"Too much." We're putting
these limits on ourselves

because we don't want to
feel like we're wasting time,

we don't want to feel lazy.

But I kind of have this
idea that we should all have

like a hedonistic revolution right now

and just let yourself chill for once.

I'm trying to let myself just enjoy things

and lay on the couch, feeling like a slob,

but removing those negative judgements.

I'm not a slob, I'm not a couch potato.

I'm a woman chilling, okay?

And there is nothing wrong with that.

Things are very stressful right now,

they can be scary,

a lot of us are going through
some very serious things

so I think especially now, but always,

we should let ourselves enjoy

the pleasure of the little things, okay?

Watch TV, watch all the damn movies.

Play video games, take naps,

call or FaceTime your
friends and family for hours,

and don't apologize for
it, don't judge yourself,

don't wonder if you're being lazy or not.

It's okay.

We need to grant ourselves the
opportunities to just chill.

But, on the other hand,

there's always another hand,

Libra here.

On the other hand, I know
that getting work done

can give us a very critical
sense of normalcy and security,

structure and satisfaction
that is very important,

especially right now.

Being busy gives us a sense of purpose

it gives us something to do with our day.

And being productive during this crisis

can be helpful for our mental health.

It can be a good distraction

it helps to give your mind
something else to focus on

other than the news.

In case it wasn't obvious already,

being productive is necessary and helpful.

You many be working from home

or you may have online classes,

I do right now.

So you've gotta do that,

those things are non-negotiable.

But other than that there are
many tasks in our lives that

may not necessarily make us money,

but they do make us feel responsible.

We feel like we're adulting.

We feel like we have our shit together.

And these tasks can help
us do the work that we want

or need to do.

So they are important.

So first thing I would recommend
is writing to-do lists.

I think writing to-do lists
on its own feels productive,

but also it helps you get organized,

get things out of your head

get it on paper so you won't
forget important things.

But during this time,

if you maybe don't have
much to actually do,

I think it can be helpful
to write down things

that are kind of basic

but at least then throughout
your day you feel like

you are "getting things
done" in some sense.

Like, wake up, stretch, brush your teeth,

shower, eat breakfast.

It is always satisfying to be
able to cross something off

your to-do list.

Also, now is a great time for cleaning.

I know some of us don't like it,

but honestly cleaning
can be very relaxing,

it can be almost meditative.

You can organize things,

you can do your laundry,

you will certainly fell better
after your space is clean

especially with so many
of us staying inside.

You don't want everything
around you to be disturbing

or distracting so having
a clean space really does

help you feel better.

And exercise.

Again it may not be the
easiest to exercise indoors

but even something like stretching

or doing yoga is a great idea.

I need to do that because
my posture is shit

and I'm spending more time
on screens than usual.

Also if you are able to, I
recommend going on a walk.

There is no pleasure greater

than going on a walk for no reason.

It is so underrated, and
we should do it more often.

But social distancing is
important so be careful.

And then there are fun things
that also feel productive.

Like reading, every
time I'm reading for fun

I feel like I'm like the
baddest bitch, you know?

I'm like, "Oh I just picked up a book,

this is the one thing I
want to be doing right now.

Stick my nose in a book!" (laughs)

Have I read anything other than textbooks

since I've been in self quarantine? No.

But I should, because it's good

and it does make me feel nice.

What's better than finishing a book?

I know I've said that
about a lot of things,

but these are top tier activities.

Also, doing puzzles.

I am such a big fan of puzzles.

My boyfriend and I are
currently working on one,

it is much more difficult than we thought.

It's been taking up our
coffee table for days

and I'm sure it's going
to be there for a while.

But, again, when you finish a puzzle,

when you put that last piece in there...

You do feel productive, you
look at that and you're like,

"Damn, I did that shit".

And it's engaging a
different part of your mind

and your body than like,
using your computer

or going on your phone,

which I like because, again,

I do that too much.

Journaling.

Big fan of journaling.

What's better than a quarantine diary?

Probably a lot of other things
are more enjoyable than that.

But it might help you emotionally

to just be able to vent about shit

whatever's on your mind,
write it down in your journal.

And then creating art.

You can draw, paint, color.

My dear friend Valaria was so kind,

she sent me a coloring
book a few weeks ago

after I posted my video about
being anxious and everything.

And she was like, "Oh,
thought this would help"

and it has, okay?

I have so much been enjoying that.

I like to watch Netflix
and color at the same time,

and I just love the focus that it takes

and then when you're done,

again, productive!

My point of this video is not that

being productive is bad

or liking the feeling
of productivity is bad,

no, of course it can be a great thing

but it's about being
productive on your own terms,

and again, not tying that
productivity to your self worth.

Okay?

I think humans love productivity.

I think it does make us
feel like we are doing

something substantial when
we get something done,

whatever that is whether it's a puzzle,

or inventing something, or writing a book,

or just doing the work that we do,

making a YouTube video.

It's not bad to love that satisfaction

I think it's a normal thing to crave that

sense of accomplishment.

But don't forget to love the
other things about yourself

that aren't tied to

the hours you put in working on something.

Okay, so finally, how are you
dealing with the situation?

I would love to hear
what you guys are up to

but also please keep
the negative bad stories

to a minimum in the comments

because I actually have a
lot of anxiety about health

and this has been
particularly triggering for me

I get really, really
nervous about getting sick,

and so that is a concern of mine,

whether it is rational or not.

And I have been staying away from the news

because for a while I was
reading it constantly,

I was on Twitter, it was all
over the trending topics,

and it like ruined me,

so currently right now
I am just focusing on

here and now.

I'm focusing on my apartment,

my boyfriend and I we're doing well,

things are good, today,

and that's all that I
can bear to think about.

I also have school work to do

which has been interesting

my classes are all trying
to transition to online

and it's been a big wacky time
for students and professors.

It's really hard to focus
on school work right now,

honestly.

A lot of it kind of feels
irrelevant or unimportant,

but again it's also kind
of a welcome distraction

and something for me to spend my time on.

Otherwise, I have just
been trying to relax.

Trying to give myself permission to relax,

enjoy time with my boyfriend,

and also I've been playing a game

called Stardew Valley.

I posted something on my
Instagram story about Farmville

and people were like,

"Oh my God, you should
play Stardew Valley!"

And I was like, "Oh, okay."

So I got it on my phone, iOS version,

and I've played it for definitely
over 30-something hours

in the last week, which is a lot.

I want to make a video actually,

about my screen time
and my phone addiction

because that is an issue.

Um, so maybe stay tuned
that might be my next video.

What else,

please watch my last video
if you haven't seen it yet.

Watch any of my old videos,

I would recommend them all.

Please give me more views.

Let's just re-watch all my videos.

And last request,

please download the app Rizzle.

I have been trying it out

and I basically see it as
like a video-response app.

It's kind of interesting,

it's always weird to try out a new app

'cause you have to figure
out like how to do it.

But I've been considering
using that platform

to ask you guys things
when I'm planning my videos

so usually I'll go on Instagram

and just get responses in messages

but I would love to actually
see your video responses

so that I can hear you
and put a face to you,

and you guys can watch
each other's responses

so I think it's just a
cool way to interact.

I mean video responses,

that's just bringing back
vintage, old school YouTube,

all right?

Remember those days?

That is all my voice is going now,

so I'm going to go chill,

please follow me on Instagram
for probably no pics

because who has content these days?

Oh maybe I can go post pictures from when

I traveled 3 years ago.

I might do that. (laughs)

Endless throwbacks.

Follow me on Twitter but I
probably won't be on there

because I'm trying to avoid Twitter so,

don't contact me on Twitter right now.

That's pretty much it,

thank you guys so much for watching.

I hope that this video was
interesting in some way

and please let me know what you think

about this whole productivity issue.

Are you being productive?

Are you not?

Probably somewhere in the middle.

But um, I hope you guys are okay

and I wish you all the best.

'Kay thanks, bye.
