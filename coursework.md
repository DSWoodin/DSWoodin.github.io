**Senior Year (2021-22)**

- **ESE450: Senior Design I**
  **Professors: Dr. Sid Deliwala, Dr. Jan Van Der Spiegel**
  **Advisors: Dr. Pratik Chaudhari, Dr. Ani Hsieh**
  This is a project-based course for engineering students that spans the course of a year.  Students work in teams of 3 to 5 to design a product or conduct research in a realm of their choice.  To learn more about this project, you can refer to my projects section, [here](https://geande.github.io/projects/).

- **ESE546: Principles of Deep Learning**
  **Professor: Dr. Pratik Chaudhari**
  This is a mathematically rigororous course delving into the underlying statistics, optimization, and calculus principals that enable deep learning.  The course also has a significant application component where students implement the algorithms, networks, and models learned in theory.  We have covered topics such as:
  - Kernels
  - Fully-Connected networks
  - Backpropogation
  - Convolutional architectures
  - Gradient Descent, SGD, and Momentum-variants
  - Recurrent architectures
  - Some Reinforcement Learning, GANs, and more.
  
  We ue Pytorch and Numpy for much of our development, and for a few of the homework assignments, I created Weights and Biases reports that I'm pretty proud of.  Here are two reports that I made:
  - [Homework 2: Adversarial Attack of CNNs](https://wandb.ai/geande/ese546-homework2p4/reports/ESE546-Homework-2--VmlldzoxMDk0NTMz)
  - [Homework 4: SGD, Momentum, Nesterov's Momentum](https://wandb.ai/geande/ese546-homework4p2/reports/ESE546-HW4-Report--VmlldzoxMjYzNTEy)

- **CIS521: Artificial Intelligence**
  **Professor: Dr. Christopher Callison-Burch**
  This is a course covering a wide array of topics in AI, and I have found it to be one of my favorite courses I have taken at Penn.  We covered the following topics:
  - Search Problems
  - Adversarial Search in Games
  - COnstraaint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)
  - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Deep Learning in Vision and Language

  One of the highlights of this course is the project offerings which let students deploy algorithms and models on a Raspberry Pi and remote-controlled R2D2 robot.  Some of these projects are on display, like [this one](https://https://geande.github.io/2021-12-09-rpi-vision/).
  
- **CIS625: Theory of Machine Learning**
  **Professor: Dr. Michael Kearns**
  This course likely has the most difficult mathematical concepts I have ever approached.  This PhD seminar introduces the PAC Learning Framework and the rigorous proofs that go behind proving learnability.  The professor is a leading figure in the fields of differential privacy and fairness in ML.  We cover these topics after laying the groundwork with learnability, shattering, consistency, uniform convergence, the VC dimension, classification, and statistical query.  I'm currently working on my final paper for the course, where I am synthesizing from recent literature in Differential Privacy and Adversarial Robustness in the context of deep neural networks.  I'll try to add a link to the paper when I am finished writing it.
