I graduated with a PhD in Biostatistics from The University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health (UTHealth) in December 2016 and recently held an appointment as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Data Science at Rice University in Dr. Marina Vannucci's research lab. Prior to this role, I served as a statistical consultant in the Biostatistics Lab at Johnson Space Center on the Human Health and Performance Contract. I recently joined the Statistics Department at Colorado State University as an Assistant Professor Fall 2020. My research interests include:


**Theory and Methods:** Bayesian modeling, variable selection, graphical models, nonparametric Bayes, statistical computing, multistate Markov models, R package development, varying-coefficient models, hidden Markov models, variational inference

**Application:** cancer prevention, smoking behaviors, mental health, addiction, physical activity, nutrition, microbiome, mHealth, ecological momentary assessment, intensive longitudinal data, environmental health, human health and performance in space
