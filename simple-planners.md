I remember standing in my kitchen stressed out, looking at my giant to do list and had no clue how to start. **Enter simple planning**. I knew something had to change, so I committed to learning a [simple planning method](The First Simple Planning Step to Take as a Beginner Planner). Now, after years of learning how to simple plan, I bring you: **MY SIMPLE PLANNERS**! Looking for **a** **simple**, **no fuss planner** that helps you stay on track without feeling overwhelmed? **My Simple Planner** was designed with _simplicity in mind_.

## MY SIMPLE PLANNER

My Simple Planner is developed based upon my own planning method, inspired by the [bullet journaling method](www.bulletjournal.com). Ready to simple plan already? You can purchase YOUR simple planner [HERE](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1240323193/my-simple-planner-weekly-daily-monthly?click_key=bfb0a546b0f16a682dd7bf2542d8e33faa94d2c0%3A1240323193&click_sum=10869fc1&ref=shop_home_active_1). You can also purchase it in a foldable mini size HERE. Keep in mind that you will be creating little booklets for each section of your planner - weekly dashboard, daily planning, and monthly planner. You can find My Simple Planner in [my Etsy Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/simplehomemomshop).

##### THE DETAILS:

**Who's My Simple Planner for?** _My Simple Planner is perfect for you if you are a beginner planner, but also have some experience with making to do lists (and losing them). It's for you if you want to get better at planning, but don't know where to start and also get overwhelmed at all of the planning choices out there._

**Why My Simple Planner over another planner?** _I can't tell you my planner is better than the rest because we all have different preferences, but I can tell you that my planner is based on my own planning methods that have been both simple and effective for me with unscrambling my mom brain! I've create My Simple Planners to be visually appealing, yet minimalistic._
