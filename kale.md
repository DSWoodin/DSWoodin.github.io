Fur Squared is a furry convention held in Brookfield, WI in February. For 2021, we're going to be holding a virtual event from February 26 - 28.

### Do I need a VR Headset?

No\! For the [VRChat](https://www.vrchat.com) segments, you can connect with a regular computer, no headset required\!

When the time comes, the main content of the event will be streamed over at Youtube, and coordination will be done via Discord. We're still working on getting those set up, and will provide links when we're ready.
