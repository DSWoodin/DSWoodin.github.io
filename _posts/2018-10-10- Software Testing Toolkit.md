You already know the basics of a testing career as well as how testing is done in the industry. In this episode, we will discuss various documents used in testing. Although we have said before that test tools, document formats differ from organization to organization. However, most tools and documents are used for the same purpose.

# What is test documentation?

The test documentation includes all the files that contain information about the testing team's strategy, progress, metrics, and results. The combination of existing data serves to measure test effort, control test coverage, and track future project requirements.

# Types of test documentation

Generally, any Test Documentation serves two main purposes. First, it provides testers with reliable data for planning and executing tests. Second, it provides updated information to project stakeholders (Designer, Development Team, Marketing, Product Owner). To serve these two main purposes, the test documentation consists of both internal and external files.

# What are the goals and objectives of software testing documentation?

QA documents collect information on test design, execution, responsible team members, metrics, and results. It provides a complex view of the project and offers many practical benefits.

Eliminates any uncertainties in test activities - Testing documentation stores detailed specifications of all planned tests, making it easy for team members and Product Owners to keep track of the product.

Helps to set up a testing environment - stores test documentation, used hardware, automation tools, framework data, and describes product performance in detail. The Testing Team may re-use this information in the future or pass it on to new members.
Offers stakeholders more insight into the testing process.
Documentation helps to analyze test effectiveness.
Most importantly, software testing documents reuse product owners and managers the oldest successful practices and save time and money by avoiding those that do not meet the KPI. It is a long-term investment that not only improves current test results but can be reused for future test tasks.

# Advantages of using test documents

[x] Improves team internal coordination and activities:
[x] Displaying test documentation to demonstrate a mature test process is also a good [x] marketing and sales strategy.
[x] Test documentation helps you to offer a quality product to the client within a specified time.
[x] In software engineering, test documentation also helps to configure or set up the [x] program through configuration documents and operator manuals.
[x] Test documentation helps you improve transparency with the client
[x] By increasing the acceptability of the project, stakeholders know that product evaluation has been successfully "passed".
[x] Improves the exchangeability of team members
[x] Accelerates onboarding of new staff
[x] Provides feedback on the planning cycle: The team initially approves the recorded plan to avoid misunderstandings at the next test stage.
[x] A reference point for future projects:

# Test Policy

It is a high-level document that describes the examination policy, procedures, and all-important examination goals of the organization.

# Test Strategy

A high-level document that identifies the level (type) of tests performed for the project.

# Test Plan

An examination plan is a complete planning document that contains the scope, method, resources, schedule, etc. of the examination activities.

# Requirement Traceability Metrics

This is a document that attaches the requirements to the test

# Test Scenario

A test scene is an item or event in a software system that can be verified by one or more test cases.

# Test Case

It is a group of input values, prerequisites for performance, expected post-execution conditions, and results. It is made for a test scenario.

# Test Data

Test data is data that exists before the test runs. It is used to make the test effective.

# Bug Report

An error report is a documented report of a bug in a software system that fails to perform its intended function.

# Test Summary Report

The test summary report is a high-level document that summarizes the test activities conducted as well as the test results.

# Special attraction

Testing is very common and some of the documents used in testing are shared for everyone's convenience. If you wish, you can add and subtract any information for your own convenience
