Handyman Work

We'll make a free visit to discuss what you want done.

We'll give you a free written estimate.

Our minimum charge for handyman work is Â£50.

We'll make best efforts to schedule your job within a month.







We will normally ask you to pay for materials up front.

When the work is completed we will invoice you for payment within one month.


We can take payments by bank transfer or cheque. We prefer not to take cash payments unless nothing else works for you.

We are privacy-focussed.
