 So, the big oddball recommendation. Read *An Ideal Husband,* and *The Importance of Being Earnest* by Oscar Wilde. These are plays, not books, but I promise you: you will laugh out loud and be amazed by how witty, conniving, and sharp tongued all the characters are. Each of these plays is about six people in love with one another doing their best to get the conversational upper-hand. They are so good. They are some of the absolute best examples of smart romance dialogue. Their "manufactured conflict" isn't authorial bullshit - it's the characters attacking each other in a desperate war to win love with clear motives and reasonable actions.

Romance with heavy fantasy elements recommendation: *Burning Bright* by Melissa McShane. This is a romance story about English lords and ladies during the start of the English empire. There's tea, crumpets, threats of forced marriage - but also our main dainty lady finds out she's a pyrokenetic who can blow gunboats out the water. She and her crush talk about their dreams, their powers, their hopes, and slowly come to love and accept each other. It's a series where the couple doesn't take till book 15 to get together.

Fantasy with heavy romance elements: *Kushiel's Dart* by Jaqueline Carry. Burning Bright is the heroic, moral kind of romantic novel. Heroes are heroes, propriety is maintained, you wouldn't be embarrased to read it in public. *Kushiel's Dart* is the sultry kind of naughty stuff - literotica, at times. There's societies built by fallen angels, religious repression, evil plots that threaten the nation, courtly intrigue, assassination, and explicit BDSM. This one's *spicy.* Not for everyone, but it's good if you're into the genre.
