# Bio

Pengbo Li, Master student at Wuhan University, working on Gravitational Wave Detection Experiment. There are still some important issues need to be solved, such as the thermal noise limit of the detector still needs to be improved. In 2019 Oct, I went to NAOJ gravitational-wave group to study the thermal noise of the test mirror. In theory, using Sapphire under cryogenic temperature can have a very low thermal absorption, but due to the birefringence effect of the sapphire, until now the result didn’t meet the sensitivity requirement of KAGRA. Apart from that，different surface coating materials can also have a significant effect on thermal noise. My current work mainly focuses on the above two points. One is to study the birefringence properties so that we can reduce the thermal noise inside the substrates, the other is to use the high-reflection crystal coating to limit the surface thermal noise.
