Back again everyone, After launching the first blog post with all the enthusiam I got derailed for a week. My mind essentially was not progressing thing in right order as there are numerous things kept on bugging me on a daily basis. Although, Most of the still not resolved but in progress to manifesting the apprach of solution or to say defining the problems in the first place. This is what I wanna talk about in this blogspot.

I don't think there is any part of the life which doesn't have problems/issues/caveats. These are bare building blocks of our lifes. Like any other journey which we usually do by car or by train we pass many stations/cities similary problems are those cities in our life's journey. Those are just steps and every step is closer to our destination. Unlike a straight forward drive, problems in our professional or personal life requires substantial patience and intelligence to solve.

## First part of solving a problem
I believe most problems in the have a solution. Infact considering the world's population its quite possible that your problem already has a solution to it. These are not limited to technical problems or factual problems. Even if we have a unique problem, the solution could potentially be drived from already solved relatable problems. What we require is **PATIENCE**.

IMO and how I enhanced my patience is by reading, handling problems in first hand. 
1. Reading helped me to find right words to understand the problem and also gain some intelligence to swiftly act on it.  

Signing off.
