As a developer, my sole purpose is to leverage technology to make life a little simpler.  

One day, the little shortcuts I saw or made will come together to form a special piece in a vastly larger puzzle and can't wait to make that contribution.  

Maybe it's farfetched but I'd love to take part and experience our society do the same;  individuals connecting and geniunely feel united together, it's a surefire way our civilization may continue evolving.

Reasons to reinstate me are below:

- I want to take full advantage of amazing services and support and continue learning in effort to better serve the community
- Making others feel good or happy has always been a top priority and would never take action with malintent and I may even ignore signs of caution or danger on my own skin
- I tend to take calculated risks, this wasn't meant to be one

Feedback is always lovely and whatever your decision, I'd love to understand steps I may take to avoid this again.

Best,
