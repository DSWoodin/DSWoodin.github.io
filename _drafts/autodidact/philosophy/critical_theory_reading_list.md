This is from r/criticaltheory and targeted toward someone who was planning a career in teaching.  You can pretty much include the same list but add auerbach, bahktin, empson, and whoever.

I haven't read empson, but the name is big enough.  TS Eliot wrote numerous critical essays.  Pound has a book on reading.

I have a soft spot for Susan Sontag's "against interpretation".
