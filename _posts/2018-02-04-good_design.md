Here we will discuss why this [student body](http://nutrition.williams.edu/) site and its pages are considered good design.

## Initial design thoughts

Nice straightforward navigation bar that any student can use. There are clear, distinct categories for many purposes. No need
to have overlapping sections.

## Choosing a tab

Again, a nice straightforward navigation bar with an explanation of Dormtrak with quantitative-based rankings of dorms.

Consensus from students is that WSO is an example of good design. The experience is pleasurable because the site is very intuitive and easy to use.
