## What to expect

I have started this Development blog as I am a distinguished computer engineer with extensive knowledge that I would like to keep a log of to reference in future for myself and other developers. 

For more information about me please see the [About Me](about) page.

I hope to cover a lot of topics and provide knowledge in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP code.

Anyways enough about me.
Thanks for checking out my blog, lets get blogging.
