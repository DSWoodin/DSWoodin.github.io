Are you swimming in clothes? Or just want to get better at figuring out what to wear? This was me a handful of years back. I asked for help from a trusted friend. And booted sooo much out. Like teacher clothes I no longer needed as a stay at home mom. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you how a capsule wardrobe can make your life easier, plus save you money long term.   
  
From there, I wanted to simplify and get better at figuring out my clothing situation. It was quite the process, but worth it now that I'm mostly out the other side. I know what I like now! I eventually learned about capsule wardrobes and created my own method (because I'm always planning ha!) for creating one because I became super overwhelmed with all of the ways they can be done. 

## So, what is a capsule wardrobe?

>   
> "Capsule wardrobe is a term coined by Susie Faux, the owner of a London boutique called "Wardrobe" in the 1970s. According to Faux, a capsule wardrobe is a collection of a few essential items of clothing that don't go out of fashion, such as skirts, trousers, and coats, which can then be augmented with seasonal pieces." (thanks, wiki) 

  
Having a smaller wardrobe, focusing on quality pieces that are classic and not [fast fashion ](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-fast-fashion)will save money from replacing lower quality pieces over the years. I took time thinking about what I'd like to keep in my wardrobe and what I'd like to add over time. Instead of just buying impulse discount purchases of low quality clothes over and over.   
  
Some examples of (new) quality pieces I've invested in:

I like to thrift our grab hand me downs over new clothing, but some things like shoes and bras I prefer new and siper hogh quality.   
  
And having a capsule wardrobe, with intentional pieces that mostly go with one another will save time picking what to wear. I'm no longer being indecisive because I have less to pick from and... Most things go together.
