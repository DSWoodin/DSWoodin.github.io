Day 9 of December is almost over, so it is time to present the nine next games in the countdown... (For methodology and introduction, please see the [previous post](/2022-12-01-top50-part1/).)

### 24. The Gallerist (2015)

My third-favourite Lacerda is still such an amazing game, and also, incidentally, my favourite art-dealer themed game...

### 23. La Granja (2015)

This game dropped 11 places, quite possibly due to lack of plays... One of my favourite examples of multi use cards in this one.

### 22. It's a Wonderful World (2019)

I'm quite surprised that this one dropped 7 places, since, it is just getting better every time I play it. A great game that works with all player counts -- even solo! Also, I've been enjoying the 'legacy' expansions that has been released for it...

### 21. Lost Ruins of Arnak (2021)

Great Indiana Jones'ey theme -- updated for the more inclusive 2020's -- with great artwork, amazing components, and, the most important, solid mechanics. Worker placement, deck builder, resources, racing... Everything. And it works.

### 20. New Frontiers (2018)

The board game based on a card game based on one of my favourite board games did not disappoint. This is, for me, just a better version of Puerto Rico. It solves my main gripe with it's predecessor -- fixed turn order, by adding a new role that lets you grab the first player marker. (This is something I would like to try to "backport" to Puerto Rico at some point...) Also, it has just a better theme. (The original's slave trade theme was never great...) 

### 19. Gaia Project (2017)

Gaia Project is another game that is just "better than it's predecessor". (...but I still prefer another game that is _heavily_ inspired by Terra Mystica... #spoileralert)

### 18. Viscounts of the West Kingdom (2020)

My third-favourite West Kingdom game is a great take on rondels.

### 17. Architects of the West Kingdom (2018)

Architects is another amazing West Kingdom game that really shines when you add the expansions to it -- especially _Works of Wonder_. (This takes the game from a BGG weight of a modest 2.76 to a decent 3.40...) Also, I appreciate how well it scales from 1(!) to 5 (or possibly also 6) players.

### 16. Race for the Galaxy (2007)

One of the oldest games on this top 50 is a modern classic that also sprung from the loin of good old Puerto Rico. So many interesting choices with one of the simplest takes on multi-use cards... Card as card, or card as money. Great, great stuff.

## Summary

So, there you have it, 16-24, or rather 24-16, of my highly... objective... top 50 games of all time. In table form it would look something like this:

| Rank | Item                                  | Change |
