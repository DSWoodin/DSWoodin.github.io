Despite the fact that I've already completed the [Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) the previous year, took (but not completed) [Udacity's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) and have completed some data science courses online, I still felt unconfident with Python. So early this year, I decided to enroll in [edX's CS1301x: Introduction to Computing using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computing-using-python-gtx-cs1301x). Now that I've finished the course, I'm happy that I have taken it and actually felt that I should have taken it the first time I started (though that wasn't possible as it only became available early this year.) I highly recommend this course for those who want to start learning Python instead of just reading a book on it. (Reading books, however still helped me understand Python the first time.) My final score was 99% but of course, I took this online, so there's not a lot of pressure as probably taking it via a real class and you take exams. There were a lot of exercises and problems, however and passing score is 80% (once you get 80%, the certificate is available to view.)

Some of the things I learned from this course but not from Codecademy or from books such as ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), which is one of my favorite books by the way, are classes, algorithms, recursive functions and Big O notation. There were other small bits that I can't recall as I write this but these are the big topics I can think of. Because of the huge amount of exercises and problems, I think it really helped me practice writing Python codes. I completed problems mostly without help, but a Slack channel for the class and a discussion group on the edX website were available for when one gets stuck. Although I started the program the time it started to become available, in February this year, I only finished it July this year. I did stop working on it for about two months or so to focus on learning recommender systems, which I was assigned to talk about at one of the meetups I attend. I also tried to learn the Python web development framework Flask, which is addicting, in between. There are just a lot of things to learn!
