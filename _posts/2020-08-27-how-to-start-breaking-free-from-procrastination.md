Ugh. Procrastination. It's annoying, isn't it? At least for me sometimes! I was reading [The Five Second Rule](https://amzn.to/3iXKRwR) by Mel Robbins and she shares about some of the research showing where procrastination comes from. Knowing where it comes from can become way more important than learning all of the time management strategies in the world. On the blog today I'm sharing about how to start breaking free of procrastination.

## Where does procrastination come from?

Procrastination can be a strategy to avoid stress. Unlike laziness, procrastination is a form of avoidance of things that may stress us out or just things we don't like to do. There's more to it than that, of course, and [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html) gives a bit more insight into it. But the fact that procrastination is often used as a stress avoider was an "aha!" moment for me.

## Look within

Procrastination is much more than meets the eye. A good thing to do to discover why you are procrastinating is to sit and write your thoughts down. Write down all the areas of your life that you procrastinate in and think about the root cause of your procrastination. For me, almost always, it's to avoid doing hard things and avoiding stress! So instead of focusing on the procrastination, I can think of ways to deal with the stress.

_If youâ€™d like to dive in deeper to your own areas of procrastination, you may enjoy the worksheet I put together that lists the four main causes for procrastination and strategies to deal with each.
