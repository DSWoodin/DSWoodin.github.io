title: About me
---

Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher, consultant, and writer. My areas of expertise include energy systems, carbon pricing, and techno-economic modeling. My work aims to address timely decarbonization challenges and inform climate policy design. In my research, I leverage diverse methods matched to the problem at hand, with a focus on quantitative models. I currently work at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research where my work covers deep decarbonization and climate policy instrument choice.

I have served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing and testified in front of legislators on climate policy. Previously I was a carbon market analyst at Thomson Reuters (now Refinitiv), where my research contributed to the reform of the European Emission Trading System. I have provided policy analyses and forecasts on European and global carbon pricing systems to governments, Members of the European Parliament, and Fortune Global 500 companies. My research has been featured in policy hearings in the EU Parliament and Commission and quoted in the media including the BBC, Wall Street Journal, Guardian, Politico, Reuters, CarbonBrief, Climate Home, Carbon Pulse, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. degree from the MIT Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. degree in Mathematical Economics from Colorado College.
