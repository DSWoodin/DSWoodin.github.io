Calling all and gearhead gadgeteers, whizzbang wizards, electric entertainers, and ingenious inventors of incredible items - we are now accepting programming submissions for FurSquared 2024! With a new hotel comes more space, and as always we need \_your\_ help to fill it!


If you have an event you'd like to host at F2 - a meetup, a discussion, a demonstration of your latest technology of the future - you can apply at <https://forms.gle/XGkGNkE8wwovJTSG7> until November 30th.


Never hosted an event before? Got a wacky idea but aren't sure if it'll take off? Don't be shy - we love innovation, and you'll not find a more welcoming audience! We're happy to work with you to flesh out an idea, and offer advice for running your panel.


Please refer to [the Programming page](/programming) for continued updates and details as they get released.
