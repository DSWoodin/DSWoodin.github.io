the swaddle women aren't funny

Greece humour was man's domaim
18th Ã©volution men humour sign of intelligence

Freud woman brain physiologically wired not for humour

subversive humour
don't recognise this humour

cultural norms on subservient women unladylike

funny men you laugh with funny women you laugh at

who shapes our sense of humour
