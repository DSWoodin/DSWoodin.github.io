Starting a website is a daunting process. But here we go ... The website is a learning resource for thoughts, questions, analysis and results inspired by discussions during statistics drop-in sessions at University. These drop-in sessions have come about from a competition that I competed in last year (2017). In this competition, I proposed a university-wide statistical support network in 90 seconds.

I didn't win anything substantial. (There was $12 000 funding up for grabs) but my pitch is [here]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EXo0Iue1es&index=1&list=PLy1v_xE3ZjaA4PFdt_FJNBLljLAiuNTiV/") Although I did not get funded that evening I did begin to build a series of relationships and collaborations that would lead to a model of this being funding until the current time.

This network is built on the back of the philosophy that collaboration and support are the building blocks of world-leading research and hold many of the solutions we are all hunting for. There is one clear object for this webpage. To provide a location where researchers and others interested in statistics can discuss and be supported to learn statistics. BUT we all have a different way of approaching challanges so to begin the content will reflex my research and tools I am using.

I have created a simple [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/") feed for new and interesting blog posts about statistics. Information from the website will be posted there iswell. All resources are open-source. Please comment and discuss any points that don't make sense. Or even better fork the [here]("https://github.com/davan690") and add any comments via git.
