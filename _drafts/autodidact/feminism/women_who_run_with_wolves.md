 I wouldn't call it 'self-help' per se, but Women Who Run With the Wolves by Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s, PhD is a book I've turned to many times over the years during different, difficult moments of my life. It does not require linear reading.

It gave me grace, it gave me understanding, it gave me my power back. Told through fairy tales and poetry, it is approachable and un-preachy. When I first began delving in, it felt like a sage had extended her hand to me; I had discovered old, sacred secrets of womanhood. I treasure the wisdom within it, and have had more questions about WWRWtW than any other book I've happened to be caught with. 

If you come from trauma, especially, ladies -- this book is for you.
