My name is Dipesh Dulal currently studying Pedagogy and Teaching for Sustainability at [UEF](https://www.uef.fi){:target="_blank"}.

### My story

I have been a teacher of various subjects since I started my teaching career in 2007. I have taught science, mathematics, social studies, computer science, English, Health and Physical Education, and mostly Environmental Education. Besides teaching, I have coordinated the relation of the school with other schools and organizations for curricular projects and exchange of lessons for enriching global learning of the pupils. I have mixed myself well in the school as a community including active involvement in the traditional areas of Nepalese school phenomena- regular lessons, exams, and extra curricular activities (ECAs). With education from Tribhuvan University, Purbanchal University, Oslo and Akershus University College, and lately University of Eastern Finland, I have transformed myself as a competent teacher, planner, and project implementor. I have gained skills also on digital pedagogy, web development, content writing, search engine optimization (SEO), and intercultural communication. With background of formal education on environmental sciences, and development studies before formal training on pedagogy and behavioral sciences, I have developed a complex mix of interests in research areas. For example, my interest on Education for Sustainability has been rooted on my profession, and education. I would love to read books on historical anthropology, especially of Nepal and Nepalmandala (Kathmandu Valley- where I belong). I am also interested on navigating the societal changes vis-Ã -vis the global trend of political economics and cultural expansion, especially driven by urbanization. You might be intrigued to know that I have coined a terminology 'spatial patrilineage' while undergoing a unfinished research work on periurbanization and it's effect from the perspectives of the people of the urban fringes. If everything permits, I will resume this work and come up with a publication.
