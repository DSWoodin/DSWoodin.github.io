My first post is about my experience learning Jekyll and Markdown.   I started this expedition by
wanting to create a company website.  I did not initially intend to have a blog, I wanted to expand my 
knowledge of git and saw an article to create a website with Git Pages and Cloudflare.  Now I am a convert.
What a good idea.  

Pagination.  This one still gets me.  Why does a page with pagination have to be called index.html.
