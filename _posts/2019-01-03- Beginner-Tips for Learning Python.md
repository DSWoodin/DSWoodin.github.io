I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.

# Why is knowing how to learn so important?

The answer is simple: as languages evolve, libraries are created, and tools are upgraded. Knowing how to learn will be essential to keeping up with these changes and becoming a successful programmer.

In this article, we will oer several learning strategies that will help jump start your journey of becoming a rockstar
Python programmer!

# Tip 1: Code Everyday

Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code
every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding
everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small
with 30 to 40 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
That's why we are going on the journey of 30 minutes a days Automation with python challenge.

# Tip 2: Write It Out

As you progress on your journey as a new programmer, you may wonder if you should be taking notes. Yes, you
should! In fact, research suggests that taking notes by hand is most beneficial for long-term retention. This will be
especially beneficial for those working towards the goal of becoming a full-time developer, as many interviews will
involve writing code on a whiteboard.
Once you start working on small projects and programs, writing by hand can also help you plan your code before you
move to the computer. You can save a lot of time if you write out which functions and classes you will need, as well as
how they will interact.

# Tip 3: Take Breaks

When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts. The Pomodoro Technique is widely used
and can help: you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to
having an eective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.
In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark
will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big dierence.

# Tip 4: Teach

It is said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. This is true when you are learning Python. There are many
ways to do this: whiteboarding with other Python lovers, writing blog posts explaining newly learned concepts,
recording videos in which you explain something you learned. Each of these strategies will solidify your understanding as well as expose any gaps in your understanding.

# Tip 5: Pair Program

Pair programming is a technique that involves two developers working at one workstation to complete a task. The
two developers switch between being the “driver” and the “navigator.” The “driver” writes the code, while the
“navigator” helps guide the problem solving and reviews the code as it is written. Switch frequently to get the benefit
of both sides.
Pair programming has many benefits: it gives you a chance to not only have someone review your code, but also see
how someone else might be thinking about a problem. Being exposed to multiple ideas and ways of thinking will help
you in problem solving when you got back to coding on your own.

# Tip 6: Build Something, Anything

For beginners, there are many small exercises that will really help you become confident with Python, as well as
develop the muscle memory that we spoke about above. Once you have a solid grasp on basic data structures
(strings, lists, dictionaries, sets), object-oriented programming, and writing classes, it’s time to start building

There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Number guessing game
- Simple calculator app
- Dice roll simulator and so on

# Tip 7: Contribute to Open Source

In the open-source model, software source code is available publicly, and anyone can collaborate. There are many
Python libraries that are open-source projects and take contributions. Additionally, many companies publish opensource projects.
This means you can work with code written and produced by the engineers working in these
companies.
Contributing to an open-source Python project is a great way to create extremely valuable learning experiences.This will enable you to learn
best practices for Python programming, as well as practice communicating with other developers

Now that you have these strategies for learning, you are ready to begin your Python journey!
