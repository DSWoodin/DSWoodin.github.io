# Bandit1 - 2


### Password: rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgziL


## Things to Know


1. **What is stdin/stdout**

 In Linux, the dash - is often used to signify standard input (stdin) or standard output (stdout) rather than an actual file name. Since I have a file literally named - and want to read it, I need to differentiate it from stdin/stdout notation.



## Problem


**Bandit Level 1 -> Level 2**


**Level Goal**


The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory


## Solving


1. **Login to the Remote SSH Server of Bandit**


   - Open a terminal and enter the following command:
     - `ssh username@hostname -p portnumber`

   - Enter the password of bandit0.

2. **Find the Password and Read the File**


- `ls` check out files located in the home directory

- I found there is a file named '-' in the home directory

- `cat -` is not right command because linux interprets '-' as a placeholder for standard input or output rather than a filename. So I need to explicitly indiate that '-' is a filename

- Prepending `./`(meaning the file is located in the home directory) to the filename tells the command that '-' is a file in the current directroy
