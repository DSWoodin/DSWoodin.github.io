# Programming Tracks at Fur Squared
Apologies for the silence here, we've been hard at work testing (and breaking) the platform we're working on for Virtual Fur Squared 2021!  We have good news though: we have a better idea of what this virtual con is going to look like.  At a high level, we're going to have two tracks, Main Events, artist/dealers, and secondary events.  Read below for details on each (as much as we have them at this point).

## Main Events Track
This will be the primary programming track, and will consist of scheduled panels, both live and pre-recorded, going from opening ceremonies on Friday, through closing events on Sunday.  In general, assume each panel slot will be 50 minutes, allowing us to pad before and after to allow for setup, transitions, and of course, any potential technical difficulties.  We're also intending to have commercials and bumps in between, telling folks what's coming up next, how to donate to the charity, and more.

### Is panel submission still open?
Yes!  [Click here to learn more about Virtual Fur Squared Programming](/programming).

## Artist/Dealers Track
We've had many excellent ideas, and if you've seen our twitter lately, you might already have an idea of what's going to happen.  In short, this stream will be a constant rotation of 6 art streams on the screen at a time, with details and links to the actual individual artist streams.  In effect, if you watch, it will rotate through what could be considered our "Dealer's Den".  Doing this won't allow audio from all of the streams, so to compensate for that, we're looking into reaching out to our many musicians and bands in the furry fandom, and having a mix of a random playlist, as well as blocks or sets.  Watch out on our twitter and here for submission forms once we're ready for that.

## Secondary Events
Traditionally we have a lot of panelling at Fur Squared, but the fact of the matter is we don't have the means to do a first time virutal event, and manage more than two streams without spreading ourselves too thin.  Our answer for this is if your panel is accepted as a secondary event, we will have it on the schedule, we will advertise for it, but it will be up to you as the panel host to provide us with the details of where it will be live, be it youtube, twitch, picarto, or other.  More details on how this will work will arrive soon.
