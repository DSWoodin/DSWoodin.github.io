After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I'm semi-retired but still good for the smaller stuff.

 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Put up a shelf
 - Fix kitchen cabinets
 - Lay tiles
 - Repair damaged walls or plasterboard
 - Clean up and re-paint radiators

And much more - ask for a quote.

Jobs that I won't take on:
  - Jobs longer than 3 days
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing
  - UPVC windows
  - Extensive outdoor painting
  - Digging
  - Ladder work (step ladders are OK)

How I work:
  - One free visit to discuss your job
  - Free quote
  - Minimum charge Â£50 excluding materials
  - Payment for materials up front
  - Best efforts to schedule your job within one month and stick to the agreed date
  - Make good and clean up is part of the service
