## Abstract

Pulsar Timing Array (Pulsar Timing Array) is currently the most promising means of detecting VHF gravitational waves (1-100 nHz). This report will introduce the basic principles of pulsar timing array detection of gravitational waves, the data processing methods of random gravitational waves and continuous single-source signals from supermassive double black holes, and the scientific potential of PTA based on FAST and SKA.
