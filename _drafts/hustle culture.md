# hustle culture

hello my name is kirthika and today i

want to talk about hustle culture

i know this is different than the

cultures that i usually talk about but i

thought it'd be fitting during a time of

quarantine where

we're often under pressure to be always

doing more and to use this time wisely

to get things done

just as a disclaimer this is going to be

talking about hustle culture on more of

an individual level

so we're not going to get into the

systemic reasons of why people need to

work three jobs in order to support

themselves

it's going to be more about how this

capitalism and hustle lifestyle has

embedded into our own

day-to-day lives let's dive into talking

about hustle culture embedded capitalism

productivity toxic productivity and how

we can combat this

just so that we're on the same page

we're going to define hustle culture as

the need to be constantly working

constantly getting more things done and

valuing productivity and money

over well-being over other personal

needs

it's essentially the concept that you

should be maximizing every second

sacrificing things in the name of

working hard and getting things done in

order to be successful

put simply it's a culture that pushes us

to do more need more

want more and i want you to keep these

two things in mind it's a culture about

wanting more and not being satisfied

with what you have

and it's also a culture about efficiency

and speed

so everything needs to be done faster

and it needs to be more efficient so why

has hustle culture gotten such a rise in

the united states

personally i think as humans we do need

culture in order to survive

cultures unite populations and they're

often what the society's values are

based off of i'm reading sapiens right

now and one of the claims the author

makes is that for humans to feel

connection with a group that's larger

than 100 people

there needs to be some kind of myth or a

ideology that's common

so that people can believe in it and

often culture is what takes this place

now despite being the united states

we're not very united as a country and

the plethora of cultures and identities

that are present in this country

make it really difficult for the

citizens to unite and

feel a common ground with anything as a

result hustle culture has become really

really common in the united states and

it's basically a modern manifestation of

the american dream

the thing is with other cultures there's

two distinctions one

is that they've often placed value on

things like rituals

ceremonies food drinks and other forms

of festivities that

add to people's lives and have some sort

of value whether that's spiritual

cultural traditional and this is what

keeps that culture going

these other cultures often are

supporting other people they serve the

community and they support the community

so there's a natural inclination to

maintain them

the problem with hustle culture is that

it's not a culture that does support

and serve individuals instead of placing

value on things such as traditions and

ceremonies

it places value on time and money and

these things are very

intangible and they're both social

constructs that are really just there to

maybe organize life but aren't

necessarily

there to bring joy and fun into

someone's life rather than being an

actual culture

i feel like it's more of a control

mechanism that slowly changes your

perceptions of things

and slowly breaks people down without

them even knowing this segways us into

the biggest problem with hustle culture

which is that

time has now become a currency you'd

probably be rich if you had a dollar for

every time you heard the phrase

time is money time is simply a social

construct and it came into existence

based on circadian rhythms

the rotation of the earth if you

actually look at the english language

there's something weird happening

with the way we talk about time and

money in english it's the same

verb that's used to refer to both time

and money you spend time

and you spend money and this really adds

to the equation

of equating time and money as something

that's comparable that's similar

if you look at hindi it's already very

different india is a culture of

a lot of get-togethers a lot of meeting

friends and family and spending time

with others

and we have completely different verbs

to refer to these two things you say

versus and these two distinctions make

the concepts of time and money very very

different it's also present in french

baseleton versus de ponce de la

and you can see it in other languages as

well with the english language being

this way your day becomes some sort of

profit maximization equation

and you suddenly start treating save

time as if it's some sort of bank

you get this little serotonin rush when

you save 10 minutes when you're cooking

your food or something and it's as if

we're putting all this time in a little

bank

but with money it is going in a bank you

know you have a savings account and your

money will stay there

but time just passes and there's no use

in putting all this time in a little

imaginary bank because it's going to

pass anyways

so you might as well use every second to

the fullest i could go on and on about

what the effects of hustle culture are

but i wanted to boil it down to a simple

concept

and that's the concept of longevity

hustle culture essentially pushes you to

sacrifice short-term fun such as hanging

out with your friends watching a movie

taking a little self-care night for

long-term gains

such as making more money being

successful in the future and never

having to work a day in your life again

the problem with this is that it's

actually a very convoluted understanding

of what short-term and long-term

is in reality the things you produce the

money you make the side hustles you have

are actually

short-term gains you get a little burst

of serotonin from it maybe it'll benefit

you a little bit

and then you're just going to forget

about it and want to do more and for

this

you're actually sacrificing your entire

long-term longevity

people often sacrifice exercising eating

right getting enough sleep

building relationships and spending time

with the people they love their health

their mental well-being

and these are all natural long-term

maintenance mechanisms

so that we can last as humans and have a

good life when we look at it on a scale

like this

it's actually quite scary what we might

be doing to our bodies by sacrificing

things that we think are not that

important to do right now

i've said it before and i'll say it

again language does create society we

use a lot of words such as the grind

never stops

rise and grind efficiency productivity

these are really big parts of our

vocabulary and

it's actually really weird that it is

because it treats humans like machines

instead of actual human beings

we also have this tendency to ask people

what their job is as soon as we meet

them instead of asking about

what they like doing or what their

interests are and this all contributes

to the idea

that you should always be hustling you

should always be grinding and

if you're not working you're not really

making any good use of your life hustle

culture is also very much upheld by the

media and we see

videos such as these ones that really

just push you to be more productive like

a machine instead of

accepting the limitations of what you

can do and working with that hustle

culture pushes you to monetize

everything that you do

there is a really big lack of hobbies in

the current society and that's basically

because

we think that oh you're learning guitar

well why don't you become a pro in three

months so that you can start your own

class and sell it online and make money

on the side or

write a book and sell your guitar songs

on the side so that you have income

coming in possibly

this is really difficult when you just

want to do something for fun and

slowly you stop losing this perception

that you can do things

that give you enjoyment that give you

fulfillment that allow you to explore

because

suddenly all of your value is placed on

money which is

what this culture values while cultures

may place value on traditions and

ceremonies

humans naturally place value on emotions

on people

on enjoyment on things that are

non-tangible but are definitely valuable

parts of our life

and this focus on money makes you forget

that these other things also have value

because inherently in a capitalistic

society

money will hold the greatest value how

is this embedded into our daily

lifestyles and the things that we do one

of my favorite examples of this

is the concept of instant food this is a

huge thing in the united states and

don't get me wrong other countries

definitely have microwavable meals as

well but americans treat cooking as if

it's a choice not a necessity can you

imagine if a lion were to say

um i'm not really gonna hunt today i

don't think it's a very productive and

efficient use of my time

but for some reason american culture has

convinced us that what goes into our

body

is not as important as just putting

something in your body it also builds

the idea that these necessary functions

of our days such as sleeping

eating are actually not that important

and that we shouldn't dedicate any time

to them

americans are also very notorious for

eating their food at their desk not

taking a lunch break

and just continuing working while eating

to continue with the analogy train

can you imagine filling a car with gas

while also trying to drive it at the

same time

it just doesn't work that way now if you

compare this to other cultures

there's this acceptance of the idea that

food takes time to prepare when i went

home i had to ask my parents how they

stand for 10 to 15 minutes to prepare

their tea every morning

when i just have to press the on button

on the coffee machine

but you can actually see this throughout

other cultures where drinks tea and

coffee

are really really essential parts of

their day and they spend time

in making sure that they're giving it

enough energy and attention that it

deserves

actually let's look more into coffee

because it actually plays a huge role in

this hustle culture thing

have you ever wondered why we have such

giant sizes of coffee in the united

states isn't there something a little

bit unnatural about the fact that

caffeine which is technically a drug

is normalized to be sold in such large

quantities what does this suggest

about the sleep americans are or are not

getting and the lifestyle that they're

leading cafes are also not a place to

hang out with your friends it's mostly a

place to get your work done

and don't get me wrong i love working at

cafes and it's probably the thing i miss

most about quarantine but it also

creates this association that

when you're working you should be

filling yourself on coffee so that you

push the limits of what your body's

capable of

and it's this endless cycle creating a

dependence on

caffeine itself rather than treating

coffee as just a drink that has caffeine

in it

this isn't common in other countries

drinks such as tea and coffee have

actually of value and are times to spend

with other people take a break and if

you take italy for example the homeland

of lattes

you actually can't take coffee to go you

have to sit at the coffee bar and

sip your coffee and other countries have

very very small sizes of coffee so that

you're not just mindlessly chugging this

liquid and instead enjoying every sip

that you have so what does this boil

down to what does hustle culture really

do

and how can we combat it essentially by

placing value on time and money

it's a control mechanism that removes

your ability to differentiate the value

of your life

independent of what you produce you

become a product and you essentially

find different ways to sell yourself

and it slowly removes your agency

because you forget that you actually

have a choice and how you live your life

and don't get me wrong i'm not perfect

and i'm no exception to this

i'm quite notorious for doing too much

and putting too much on my plate

and it can really make you forget to

zoom out and just take some time for

yourself

but i have developed some mechanisms in

order to combat this embodied capitalism

in me

and i wanted to share them with you guys

now i'd love to dismantle the system

just as much as the next person

but we're going to focus on changes that

you can make on an individual level

and in keeping with the theme of this

channel spreading love to yourself and

your own life

and valuing it as you should now i

mentioned two key words in the beginning

and those were more

and fast i know this is kind of a

buzzword but practice mindfulness

de-automate your life turn off your

google home or alexa

stop asking siri to do things for you

i'm sure you can turn on your lights by

yourself

and just take a second to appreciate

everything you have around you grind

your own coffee cook your own food

make your own meals and really

appreciate everything you have in your

life

and create this association of being

content with less or being content with

what you have

rather than wanting more in order to

feel content since hustle culture is all

about

wanting more doing more you have to

associate happiness with

less in addition try to do everything

that you do slowly

healthful culture is about fast it's

about efficiency

but in reality what's wrong with doing

things slowly if you're enjoying every

moment that's spent doing them there's

no need for quick workouts and quick

walks and quick face times with your

family

take your time and ignore what the clock

says especially if you have the ability

to do that this will remove the

association of contentment being linked

to

speed and instead allow you to enjoy

every second of your life

no matter if you're doing something very

quickly or you just got one thing done

during the day the last mindset i would

say

is actually the most important and it's

to appreciate yourself

appreciate the way you do things

appreciate your natural features your

hair

your face things that make you happy

that make you sad

just value yourself because hustle

culture is essentially a ploy

to make you not value yourself to feel

that you're not enough

unless you're doing something producing

something and i think that's the biggest

thing that we need to combat

you as a human being are whole you're

full and you're enough and you don't

need anything else to justify that if

you want some more media on this topic i

have two book recommendations

how to do nothing by jenny odell and

tell with the hustle by jefferson bethke

are both really great looks

at hustle culture and capitalism culture

in two very different ways i also made a

little video last week

that's called existential edits it's the

first of

i hope many episodes because i have a

lot of thoughts in my head that i like

to share

and that one is basically a more perhaps

poetic

and abstract look at society at

capitalism

and how we can resist it so if you have

a couple minutes go ahead and check it

out it's a little bit of a different

piece but i do like it a lot

if there are other cultures you would

like me to unpack whether they are

ethnic based

or society based let me know and i'd be

happy to take a look at them

aside from that thank you so much for

watching i really appreciate it and i

will see you next time

bye
