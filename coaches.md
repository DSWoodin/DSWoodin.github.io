RMS Math Club thrives thanks to its volunteer coaches.

# Responsibilities
Prospective coaches are expected to actively participate in running the club. This involves a few important commitments that
require around 3 hours per week.

1. Coaches prepare material for our weekly coaching sessions. This includes defining homework and classwork, as well as
being intimately familiar with the solutions for those problems.

2. Coaches lead our weekly coaching sessions. While the level of math proficiency and experience varies across rooms, all
coaches need strong communication skills and mastery of middle school math topics. Coaches are usually paired so that the
workload can be shared.

3. Coaches develop questions for our <a href="/exams">internal exams</a>. Each coach will be assigned a suggested set of 
topics to produce 8-10 questions designed to challenge our membership.

If you would like to volunteer to coach our sessions, please reach
