Here's the thing -   

I created this site three months ago with the intention of writting my first blog post to explain exactly how to get this complicated process off the ground (at least for me as a total novice with respect to HTML, GitHub, and computer programming in general). But this isn't a website about web design (far from it!). I had to leave the weekend's work behind; which is to say I didn't write any of it down, forgot how I did what I did, and well, that is kind of the **ENTIRE POINT** of this website. As a scientists, I'm supposed to be trained in the dark arts of expert record keeping, but the reality is that it's really time consuming to keep such detailed notes, and I've found myself to be more and more impatient as I've gotten older (but apparently not wiser). This site reflects my first earnest attempt to not only document the things that are really easy to do **once you know what you're doing** but are _REALLY HARD_ if you've **never done them before**.   

Not having documented the step-by-step process of constructing this site led me to having to sift through scattered bits of code I had created to figure out what I had done in the first place, _which took way, way longer than it should have_. Which brings me to the whole point of this site:   

`LET'S MAKE WORKFLOWS FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING SO THEY CAN DO IT FASTER`

So how will this all work? ...

The layout, as mentioned on the [Home page](https://devonorourke.github.io/) is really simple: 
1. There's a page where I'll introduce the topic we're dealing with in a blog format - like the very one you're reading right now - under the [Learning](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page. In some instances the entirety of the post will be self contained (read: if it's really simple). In other cases I might write a short blog outlining the basic premise of the project but then link to a separate page where the gory details are provided in full - specifically, you'll find these longer posts under the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/teaching/) page. For example, if you're interested in how to build a website like this one from scratch, I've documented [that process here]**(??? link ???)**.  

2. There's a [Doing](https://devonorourke.github.io/doing/) page where I'll provide overviews about the science I've been involved with. Interested in experimental evolution of microbial communities? Me too! How about white nose syndrom and the genetics of adaptation? Also me too! How about poop!? Not so much? Well I think it can be pretty useful. It's my hope to share as much of the techniques and results as I can in a detailed yet approachable way.

3. As mentioned in the first point, you'll find the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page particularly useful for extensive documentation outlining how do do a process introduced in a blog. Buyer beware - code changes quick, so be sure to take not of when the post was written as things may have changed (possibly substantially).  

I always appreciate feedback so feel free to [get a hold of me](mailto:devon.orourke@gmail.com) if you have a comment.  

Thanks for visiting!
