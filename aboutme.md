### My story

My name is Rodrigo Alejandro Vargas Hernandez. I was born in the great Mexico city in the late 80s.
As any other mexican kid, I grew up playing soccer. However, as I got older and "wiser" my taste for sports change and I fall in love with cycling and basketball.

I did my undergraduate at the National Autonomus University of Mexico (UNAM) where I got my degree in Chemistry. While doing my undegraduate I found out that my main interest was not on wet chemsitry but rather how to simulate chemical reactions with computers.
This made me move to Vancouver Canada to prosue my PhD under the supervision of professor R. Krems. 
During my PhD I found two new passions that changed my life, cycling and machine learning. The later became the main topic of my research career.
