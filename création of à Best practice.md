# création of à Best practice

Once all nuance is lost, the conditions are perfect for the idea to spread. It originated from someone with respect, experience, and authority. The simplicity makes it sound easy. People who don’t understand it sell it as a panacea. As a result, people can learn about it quickly and start evangelising. Despite its merit-based origin, it has become a social phenomenon.

When we lack the experience and confidence to form our own opinions, we defer to the next best thing: an authority. This is a well-known cognitive bias.

A way to hedge our bets. If we are wrong, we can defend ourselves by saying that we just followed best practices. How could someone blame us?
A way to mimic the best. If someone we see as an authority does something, it’s natural for us to try to learn and copy what they do.
A virtue-signalling mechanism. If something is “the best”, we naturally want to signal to everyone that we also do what is best.
A way to fit in. If everyone around us considers something “the best”, we would be hard-pressed to go against our peers.
