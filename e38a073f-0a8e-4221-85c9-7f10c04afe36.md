 I feel theoretical books are far more important than pop/hard non fiction.

- **Concrete Mathematics**: A Foundation for Computer Science by Knuth et al.
- **Introduction to Algorithms**, by Cormen et el ( or **The Algorithm Design Manual** by Steven Skiena — I'm particularly fond of this book than CLRS as I used it a lot during my undergrad while preparing for ACM-ICPC )
- **Computer Organization and Design**: the Hardware/Software Interface, by David A Patterson and John L. Hennessy
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant
- **Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms** by David MacKay (Free)
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** by Harold Abelson
- **The C Programming Language**, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie ( though this is a good book, there are far better books for C such as **C in a nutshell** by Prinz, **Keneth Reek's book on Pointers** or **Deep C Secrets** by Peter van der Linden)

Small but significant, language dependent:

- **Writing An Interpreter In Go** by Thorsten Ball (I don't really use Go but this book was lovely!)
- **Eloquent JavaScript** by Marijn Haverbeke, a fantastic introduction to JS.
- **Hacking: the Art of Exploitation** by Jon Erickson, worth a read.

Adding some non-fiction for casual reading:

- **Mathematics – From the Birth of Numbers** by Jan Gullberg
- **The Annotated Turing** by Charles Petzold

---

Caveats:

- **Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid** is probably recommended by a lot of folks but I think it's better to read this after you're experienced. Don't start reading this when you're a beginner as many topics discussed are much more beautiful if you have formal, rigorous lectures on them.
- **The Art of Computer Programming** (all volumes) by Knuth, this will definitely go as a classic, a collectors piece in the future, a fantastic compendium of computer science knowledge. Read this after good exposure to fundamental concepts as Knuth uses his own MMIX architecture (RISC) for examples.
