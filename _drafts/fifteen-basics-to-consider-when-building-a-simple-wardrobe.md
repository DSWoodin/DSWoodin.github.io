**_What are the basics in your wardrobe?_**

Before switching to a smaller, [everything goes together wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe), I had too many categories of what I thought were basics. Jeans. Leggings. Dress pants. Maxi skirts. Joggers. Ah! Right?

**_So where do you start if you're wanting to declutter your wardrobe?_** One place can be basics! Today on the blog, I'm sharing fifteen potential simple wardrobe basics for you. I say potential because everyone will have different preferences.

The best way I've found to go about finding out what basics work best for me it is to ask myself some questions:

* What's my lifestyle like - i.e. what is practical wardrobe wise for my life right now?
* What kinds of clothing do I like wearing?
* Can I remove some "basics" categories and simplify (such as one or two kinds of bottoms vs seven)?

For me, in one basic category for instance, that became leggings only for long pants for me eventually.

**Here's the list of fifteen basics for building a simple wardrobe:**

 1. [Tank top](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101leRdT) (recent purchase for my simple wardrobe after thinking about it for TWO years is a butter soft, molds to the body shelf tank by knix) You can find them [here](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101leRdT) (affiliate link) and also use the code knix10 for 10% off too if you like the look of them too.
 2. Basic short sleeve tee
 3. Long sleeze blouse
 4. Long sleeve tee
 5. Jeans
 6. Leggings (I linked the leggings I wear in my [Amazon shop](www.amazon.ca/shop/eastcoastkelly) for you)
 7. Dress pant
 8. Skirt
 9. Long skirt
10. Shorts
11. Black Dress
12. Blazer
13. Poncho
14. Sweater
15. Cardigan
