Finding a job in datascience requires a multitude of different skills and interests. A working understanding of statistics, computational and mathematical modeling, database design and interface, and a whole host of programming languages are all required. Languages like R, Python, C++, Java, Go, and Julia, join many others in a constantly shifting landscape of 'preferred qualifications' facing a job seeker looking to break into the field. Acruing the required expertice seems like a challenge of sisyphean proportions, particularly given the rapidly changing face of technology leading me to feel stretched thin like some kind of technological octopus trying to hold on to everything. This is similar to the problem of the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking Glass*. Here the Red Queen tells Alice, "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

In evolutionary biology, Red Queen dynamics have been used to explain everything from extinction rates to the evolution of sexual reproduction. When it comes to job hunting it can also serve as a reminder to stop running for a moment and focus on the fundamentals. What skills and traits are universally required for the job? For science things like curiosity, basic mathematical rigour, and the ability to break a complex problem down into algorithmic steps are undoubtably more important than knowledge of some specific soon-to-be-supplanted too. My hope is that by focusing on these fundamental traits it will be possible to overcome the imediate onset of crippling imposter syndrome that often accompanies facing the job market. Because science is so much more than simply a collection of tools.
