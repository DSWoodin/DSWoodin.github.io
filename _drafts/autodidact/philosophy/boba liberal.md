[[boba liberal]] is someone who centers her Asian identity in buzzy cultural objects and “trend-chasing spectacle” but lacks true engagement with the politics of her Asian identity. It’s the Asian who can’t stop talking about “Crazy Rich Asians” as a breakthrough in Asian representation, or who posts boba selfies as a way to prove her Asian bona fides while, elsewhere, seeking acceptance within white culture

 an identity is as much about how you are perceived as it is about what you mean to project.
