Metabolomics is the study of small molecules that act as precursors, itermediates, products of biochemical pathways (downstream of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome). Therefore, metabolomics techniques allow assessment of biochemical perturbations at a global level: a metabolomics profile.  Through the use of metabolomics technology, which includes mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a wide range of metabolites have been elucidated, including those in the following categories: vitamins, food additives, pharmaceuticals, recreational drugs, pollutants, toxins, peptides, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, and biogenic amines. Metabolomics is considered to link the genome (and its downstream multi-omic components) and the phenome, and as such, metabolites are often referred to as “intermediate phenotypes.” Metabolomics approaches have been leveraged to identify key biomarkers of numerous health phenotypes, including: coronary artery disease, blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obesity.
