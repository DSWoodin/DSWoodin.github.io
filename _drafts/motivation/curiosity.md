 I’m an astrophysicist and I work specifically on exploring distant planets. Curiosity alone and covered in dust should not make you sad. Curiosity WANTS to be there, even if alone. Think more of a child, excitedly covered in mud after jumping in puddles. He is so psyched to be the hero for his mothers and fathers who built him, and he knows he’s doing an amazing job. He has already surpassed all our expectations, so whenever he needs to retire, it will be well-deserved with a smile on everyone’s faces. Even when he powers down, he won’t be dying — he’ll just be going to bed after a very long, hard, fruitful day of work.

...some of my own feelings of anthropomorphism *may* be coming into play here, but I’d say most of this is my professional opinion.
