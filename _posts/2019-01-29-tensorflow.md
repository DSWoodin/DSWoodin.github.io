# `What is Tensorflow ?`
Tensorflow is an opensource machine library for research & production .
* Made up two terms : Tensor + Flow 

# Goal
* Understand the basic structure of a Tensorflow program .
* Be familiar with main code components .

# Basic code structure
* View functions as computational graphs
* Build a computational graph and then use a session to execute operations in the graph .

# What are Tensors ?
Tensors are just multidimensional array . Just like

>>Again , tensorflow is a library based on Python use for deep learning & provides different types of 
functionality for deep learning models .

# What is Flow ?
Refers to the series of operations perfoemed on tensor .

# *Tensorflow involves two steps* 
* Building the computational graph
* Running the computational graph .

We'll see a simple code using tensorflow & then a computational graph of this code .

Let's practice !
