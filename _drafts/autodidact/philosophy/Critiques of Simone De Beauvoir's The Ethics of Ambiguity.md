Arp's 'the bonds of freedom', which looks at Beauvoir's ethical work, EA in particular and is both accessible and useful. Other good commenters on Beauvoir include Bergoffen, Kruks and Simmons, although sometimes they look more at the second sex (or will assume you're familiar with it).

de Beauvoir's views are very close to many Kantian constructivists, such as Korsgaard and O'Neill, but I think the criticism of them is easier to find. I think if you read the replies to Korsgaard's _The Sources of Normativity_ (helpfully contained in the same text), you'll find some of them relevant. Bernard Williams even calls Korsgaard's lecture an 'existentialist' interpretation of Kant.

The _Cambridge Companion to Existentialism_ includes an [essay](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-existentialism/simone-de-beauvoirs-existentialism-freedom-and-ambiguity-in-the-human-world/703A3EC2EEDFBB01DED7C8D059B411BE) on Beauvoir's existentialism which should be of interest to you.
