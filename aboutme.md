Iâ€™m Musa, a software developer with expertise in iOS Development, currently based in Munich.
I've been developing mobile apps since 2019, and it has become more than just a profession to me; it's a passion that extends beyond my work life. I enjoy reading technical material, writing, and working on side projects. Converting my knowledge into any kind of output, whether through code or other means, motives me to excel in my profession.
