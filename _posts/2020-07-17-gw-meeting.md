## Abstract

In recent years, machine learning (ML) technology has been widely used in many fields such as astronomy and cosmology. In this talk, I will briefly review the applications of ML in cosmology and introduce our recent applications of ML in cosmology. Specifically, we propose that artificial neural network (ANN) can be used to estimate cosmological parameters and a code called ECoPANN (Estimating Cosmological Parameters with ANN) is developed to achieve parameter inference. This method can obtain the same results as the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, and may provide an alternative way to accurate and fast estimate cosmological parameters for large samples of data, which is beneficial to the research of cosmology and even other broader scientific fields.
