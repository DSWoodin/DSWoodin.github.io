## The Fursquared 2022 Poster\!

**Poster: Limited 50 slots, $200 if selected please read the terms for our Poster Lottery below:**

Poster Lottery Terms

The Fur Squared poster is happening\!&nbsp; Here’s how you get in: When you register for Fur Squared 2023, there will be a checkbox and a link to this document.&nbsp; Read the entire document, and check the box to acknowledge your entry into the 2023 poster raffle.

Entry into the lottery will last until Sunday, February 11 at 11:59pm central.&nbsp; Assuming there are more than 50 people interested in the poster tier, 50 random people will be picked, and announced on Monday, February 13.&nbsp; On that date, emails with special registration upgrade links will be sent out.&nbsp; The price for the Poster tier is $200.&nbsp; Your cost will be the difference between that and what you paid for your existing badge.

If you do not complete your upgrade and payment by Sunday, January 16 at 11:59pm central, we will go to the next name in a randomized standby list, and will continue to do so until all poster slots are filled.If you miss your chance, we’re sorry, but that will be final\!

Without proof of vaccination a registration WILL NOT be given.

Email us at: [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com)<br>Fur Squared thanks you for your patience.

# FAQ

## What kind of ID is valid for checking in to get my badge during registration and vaccine check?

- We require you to have a government issued ID that has your picture and date of birth on it along with legal first and last name. If you have changed your name the ID’s First and Last legal names should match that what was submitted during your registration.

## I’m under 18 or I’m bringing a minor do they need an ID as well?

- If you are attending alone but have a signed consent form that was legally notarized you will be fine but you must have your consent form filled out by a legal notary. Failure to comply with notarizing the form will result in your registration being withheld until a guardian is present.

- If you are a guardian accompanying the minor during the registration process you can sign the consent form at the door and no ID for the minor will be required. They will still need to register if they are above the age of 13 but will not be required to show ID if the paid attending adult is with them during the registration process.

## I am a parent accompanying my child to watch over them while they attend the convention. Is there a badge for that?

- Yes, we do offer a Parent in Tow (“PIT”) badge for parents that are just attending to walk along with their children or minors. Requirements for this is that there must be at least one purchased attending badge in order to be given such a badge. Only one for each parent and you will be given the opportunity to name your parent in tow badge or you can keep it at the default PIT badge name.

## I’m attending the convention and bringing someone under 13 years old. What do I need to do for their badge?

- Similar to the Parent in Tow badge, you can also get one for kids 13 and under called a Kid in tow (“KIT”) badge. Requirements for this is that there must be at least one purchased attending badge by the parent with their information submitted into registration.  Do not pre-register someone under 13 as we will have to redo the registration under the parent’s information.

## I’m accompanying someone to the convention as a caretaker and I am required to be with them always. Do I get a caretaker badge?

- FurSquared will happily assist with caretakers and their registrations. What would be required is there to be at least one purchased attending badge by the person that is attending for themselves. Please reach out to registration@fursquared.com so we may assist you ahead of time.

## Will there be daily badges for the weekend?

- Yes, we will offer daily badges for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

## Help! I’ve lost my badge at the convention! What should I do?!?!

- You will be required to head back to registration and purchase another attending level badge at full cost, as no refunds will be issued if you lose your first original badge. However, if you should find your badge after you have purchased a replacement, you can bring back the reprinted badge to registration and receive a refund of the second badge. The reprinted badge will be destroyed before you receive the refund.
