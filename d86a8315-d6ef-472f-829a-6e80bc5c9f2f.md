 I didn’t click through to your comic, but no, it’s not funny to me to make “jokes” about how toxic it is for women in tech—it’s my daily struggle, and it’s hard. Yes, female software engineers get “mistaken” for support staff. It’s not even slightly funny when it happens to you. I don’t enjoy being reminded how “funny” men find it.

Yes, tech reddit is a very toxic space to talk about being a woman in tech. I once commented on a post, I think it was r/programming, about how emphasizing “culture fit” in the interview process is a way for white men to rationalize their discrimination. I have been axed from the interview process so many times for “culture fit”... I gave the example that I have autoimmune disease and can’t do gluten at all, or really much of any alcohol. So when interviewers ask me “what’s your favorite kind of beer?”, it’s not something I can answer. I get discriminated against for completely non technical reasons. It’s a valid point, but I got downvoted into oblivion and a lot of nasty comments (and not one supportive comment). I never commented or even read a comment thread on that sub again.
