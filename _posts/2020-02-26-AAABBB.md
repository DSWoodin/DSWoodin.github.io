Plugins are great, but I keep their use to a minimum and do not rely too much on third parties. However, there are some little helpers that I wouldnâ€™t want to do without. Not all of them may be the latest hot stuff, but they are the solid ones that accompany me daily.

Oxygen, doctolibâ€™s design system, has existed for more than three years now and is becoming more and more robust. Three years of adding new components, new processes, breaking changes due to Figmaâ€™s new features (such as auto-layout), component updates or recraft, drifts (discrepancies between design component and dev component)â€¦

All this leads to a Figma library (formerly called ðŸ’ Core components) that was closer to a Frankenstein than a lean and refined library as we would have liked.

In parallel, we were regularly receiving negative feedback from the Product Designers, notably mentioning that Figma files were really heavy, and consequently slooooooooow and annoying to work on. Massively important if you consider that a Product Designer works at least half the day on Figma.
