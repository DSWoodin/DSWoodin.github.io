 They don't respect you not doing things that make you uncomfortable. For example if they keep asking you to have your hair a certain way (even though you really don't want your hair like that), wear certain clothes that you feel uncomfortable wearing, wear makeup even though you hate it, etc. If you tell them something you feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable doing something and they can't respect that, they're not right for you.
