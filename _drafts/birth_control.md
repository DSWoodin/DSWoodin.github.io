 Vasectomies are increasingly being seen as temporary birth control as well. 

Many men can still plan a family post-vasectomy. Pregnancy rates after reversal range from 30-90%. There are doctors who specialize in reversal. Men can also bank their sperm prior to the vasectomy, just in case. They also still produce sperm after a vasectomy, it simply no longer mixes with semen and is reabsorbed by the body. Therefore, sperm can be withdrawn and used to fertilize s partner’s egg by IVF with a decent degree of success.

1. Vasectomies are extremely safe. There has never been a death attributed to the procedure. Side effects and complications are rare. Female contraception options have well-known side effects which can be severe, including death. Pregnancy carries its own set of health risks, including death, as well as disproportionate risk to women’s lives, including their social status, relationships, and careers.
2. Vasectomies are no more invasive than a woman getting an IUD implanted. 
3. Men cause 100% of unwanted pregnancies. If you’ve never read Gabrielle Blair’s viral Twitter post, here’s a [link ](https://humanparts.medium.com/men-cause-100-of-unwanted-pregnancies-eb0e8288a7e5) to the unrolled version. It’s a short, searing read.
