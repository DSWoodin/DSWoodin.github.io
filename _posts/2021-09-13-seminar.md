## Abstract

X-ray binary stars are binary star systems composed of compact stars (black holes or neutron stars) and companion stars (ordinary stars). X-ray binary stars provide a unique window for us to study extreme physical processes in the state of strong gravitation, strong magnetic field, and ultra-dense matter due to the short evolution time scale. For low-mass X-ray binary stars, when matter is accreted from the companion star to the compact star, an accretion disk will be formed, and most of the gravitational energy will be released in the form of X-ray radiation. By observing the radiation transfer and luminosity changes caused by the accretion of matter, we can study the geometry of the radiation area near compact stars on different time scales ranging from milliseconds to months, and then limit the mass and spin of compact stars. . When compact celestial bodies accrete matter, they will generate significant feedback to the external environment through the coil wind (that is, outflow), and ultimately affect the evolution of compact celestial bodies. The study of coil wind is very important for understanding the accretion and feedback process of dense celestial bodies. In this report, I will combine my work to introduce the physical processes of accretion and outflow in low-mass X-ray binary stars.
