When it comes to answering the question of "What's the best gun in Destiny 2 for PvP?" answering that question is fairly easy. All you need to do is head over to [Destiny Tracker's Insights page](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights) and see what the most used guns are, and those are probably the best. Answering the question of *why*, however, can be somewhat difficult, as there are a multitude of ways one weapon can hold an edge over another. From varying stats, differing time-to-kill (TTK) values between sub-types, different perk pools, or, in the case of exotic weapons, special abilities, these are just a few ways some weapons can rise in use amongst so many choices.

In the Crucible, the most common type of loadout to bring is to pick one primary and one special weapon, denoted by the respective white and green ammo boxes on the icons of the weapons. Shown in the picture above is a loadout comprised of Bygones, a pulse rifle, in the kinetic slot, Mindbender's Ambition, a shotgun, in the energy slot, and Thunderlord, an exotic machine gun in the power slot. Primary weapon have deep, always-full ammo reserves, and are generally used for gunfights, designed to be, as the name implies, a guardian's primary weapon. Special weapons on the other hand, are severely limited in both ammo reserves, but also starting ammo, with most special weapons only starting with two shots to fire. To make up for this, special weapons have the ability to take down enemy guardians in one shot, provided the wielder can meet the requirements to do so; for example, shotgun wielders need to be very close to their enemy to get a one-shot-kill, whereas sniper rifle wielders need to land a shot on an enemy guardian's head to take them down in one blow. |

###### Side note: The gold borders around the weapon icons denote that the weapon has been "masterworked". Legendary weapons gain 10 points in the given stat noted on the weapon's masterwork icon when fully upgraded, however exotic weapons can gain many more stats, and sometimes even extra perks when masterworked, however the process of doing so is much more rigorous.

Incidentally, primary and special weapons are not restricted to the slots they inhabit, as shown by this loadout comprised of Revoker, a sniper rifle, in the kinetic slot, Sunshot, an exotic hand cannon, in the energy slot, and Hammerhead, another machine gun, in the power slot. Additionally, because Sunshot is in the energy slot, that means that Thunderlord, from the previous loadout, had to be unequipped, as guardians can only equip one exotic weapon at a time.

By far one of the most used types of primary weapons, and weapons in general, are hand cannons. These guns make up over a quarter of all weapons used in the crucible, rivalling that of every other primary weapon type combined. These aptly-named slow-firing revolvers pack quite a punch, with most, if not all, being able to down an enemy guardian in a second or less. These weapons are killer in the hands of skilled players, usually knocking out an opposing guardian in three shots (or three bursts, in the case of Crimson), and are also an exceptional primary weapon choice for mid-range battles.

With the nerf to hand cannon range that came with the previous season, Season of Undying, all hand cannons, regardless of archetype, now start falling off in damage between twenty-three meters at a range stat of 0, and twenty-six meters at 100. This has resulted in a rise in popularity of lightweight hand cannons like Spare Rations, whose archetype grants them implicitly high handling, essentially changing a battle of range to a battle of speed. In this case, lightweight hand cannons (and by extension Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten) reign supreme, because not only do they have the fastest optimal time-to-kill, but their stats are higher in the catagories that matter, namely handling, aim assistance, and reload speed.
