<!---
**I was born** in Mexico city, and I lived a couple of years in Vancouver during my graduate studies. In the summer of 2019, I moved to Toronto to continue my academic carrear. 
In my spare time I usually practice *bike&beer* or *cafe&cletas*, choose a craft brewery or a coffee shop and cycle there. Before the pandemic I used to play basketball too.
