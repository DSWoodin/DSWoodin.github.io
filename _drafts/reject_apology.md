 You aren't the bad person. The other person is admitting they wronged you. You can stand up and say this:

* "Thank you for your apology. I appreciate it. I also **do not forgive you**. You have done the same wrong against me over and over and your wrongs have grown in intensity and audacity. I will no longer validate your wish for reconciliation because you're only going to betray our relationship or disrespect me again. BYE."
* Or if you don't want to cut ties and you just want to put the person in time out: "Thank you for your apology. I appreciate it. I also **cannot forgive you right now**. You have done the same wrong against me over and over and your wrongs have grown in intensity and audacity. I am not validating your wish for reconciliation because you need to learn that your actions have consequences. Today the consequence is I don't forgive you right now and I don't want to talk to you or be around you. Maybe one day after I am less hurt and you are more mature I can consider forgiving you. Now BYE."

Not only CAN you stand up for yourself, YOU SHOULD stand up for yourself. I am all for saying thank you for your apology, I don't accept it and I don't forgive you. Own your own happiness. If it doesn't make you happy to forgive a person then don't. People will walk all over your apologetic self. Don't let them. Don't enable their bad behavior. Put your foot down and demand that you be treated better or kick them to the curb.

Feel free to practice the mini speeches or shorten them. Rewrite it, own it, dumb it down if you need to or spice it up with some truth bombs. If you do go the mini speech route, I highly suggest you read it aloud a few times so you can pretty much go off of memory. Also, speak slowly and enunciate because they won't know what's coming to them and they're going to need the extra time to process the words coming out of your mouth.
