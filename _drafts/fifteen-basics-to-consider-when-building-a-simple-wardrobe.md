What are the basics in your wardrobe?

Before switching to a smaller, [everything goes together wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe), I had too many categories of what I thought were basics. Jeans. Leggings. Dress pants. Maxi skirts. Joggers. Ah! Right?

_So where do you start if you're wanting to declutter your wardrobe?_ One place can be basics! Today on the blog, I'm sharing twenty potential simple wardrobe basics for you. I say potential because everyone will have different preferences.

The best way I've found to go about finding out what basics work best for me it is to ask myself some questions:

* What's my lifestyle like - ie what is practical wardrobe wise for my life right now
* What kinds of clothing do I like wearing? 
* Can I remove some "basics" categories and simplify (such as one or two kinds of bottoms vs seven)?

For me, in one basic category for instance, that became leggings only for long pants for me eventually.

**Here's the list of twenty basics:**

Tank top (recent purchase after thinking about it for two years is a butter soft, molds to the body shelf tank by knix) You can find them here (affiliate link) and also use the code knix10 for 10% off.   
 Basic short sleeve tee  
 Long sleeze blouse  
 Long sleeve tee   
 Jeans   
 Leggings (linked mine....)   
 Dress pant   
 Skirt   
 Long skirt   
 Shorts  
 Black Dress   
 Blazer  
 Poncho  
 Sweater  
 Cardigan
