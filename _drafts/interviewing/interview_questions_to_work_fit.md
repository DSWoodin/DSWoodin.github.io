"What has been the most satisfying project you've worked on at Company X". No one expects it yet they all react positively.

What did the last three people on your team get promoted for?
    What the promotion question shows is what the team actually values. Did they reward the guy who came up with a concept? Did they reward the guy who took a project from concept to production? Did they reward the guy who is maintaining a large code base with lots of changes happening? Did they reward a guy who went outside of his normal duties?
    
    Or did they promote people who had been with the organization a long time? Was it someone's turn to get promoted? Does the interviewer snerk at or roll his eyes about who was promoted, meaning he didn't think it was deserved? Does he think bullshitters and nepotism is what gets you promoted?
    
    Or does he not know what people on his team got promoted for, indicating that he has no care over his own career, or that it's very secretive and therefore arbitrary?

"Say that you hired me, and a year from when I start, you look back and think about how glad you are to have hired me. What would I have accomplished in that year to make you feel that way?"

approx order:
    Interviewer and Company - Get to know who I'm talking to, so I may adapt accordingly.

    Work - Get a good idea of what they want from me, as well as an opportunity to talk about how I can provide that.

    Professional Development - All companies pretend to hire the best. Active (not passive) support of Professional Development is a good sign. Showing interest in this also helps me.

    Deadlines & Tasks - I'm screening for two things here. How much power do the engineers actually have over their work, and work-life balance. If engineers have little influence, that's a bad sign.

    Happiness & Worklife Balance - Generally best to not lead an interview with these questions, as that comes across as lazy. That said, I don't mind companies that screen me out, because they're looking for 50+ hour/week workers. I'm also done with working miserable jobs, so unsatisfactory answer here are a no-go.

    Office - About half of these are things I'll attempt to observe in person. I won't generally spend much time on these questions, but getting a good idea of the environment I might work in every day is VERY important.

    Resources and Perks - I generally finish with this. I usually approach it from a "are there any other awesome perks I don't know about?" perspective.
    
    
        What version control system do you use?
    
        What branching strategy do you use?
    
        What method of deployment do you guys run?
    
        Do you practice TDD and/or BDD?
    
        What is a typical day like?
    
        What is a project that challenged you here at work?
        
        
What is a typical day like for you? (Assuming your interviewer is another developer.) 
What are your expectations for a new employee on their first X days of the job?
