Are you often writing down mega to do lists and get frozen with overwhelm and indecision? This was me too! I remember standing in my kitchen stressed out, looking at my giant to do list and had no clue how to start. Enter simple planning.

My Simple Planner is developed based upon my own planning method, inspired by the bullet journaling method. Ready to simple plan already? You can purchase your simple planner here.
