Previously, performance optimization meant only server-side optimization. Because most of the websites were static and their processes were done on the server side.
However, with the advent of Web 2.0 technology, web applications have become more dynamic. As a result, client-side code performance has become an important requirement.

# What is GUI Testing 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is usually a process to verify the expected performance of visual elements such as text, images, buttons, as well as their functional accuracy.
By testing the graphical user interface, the testing team can verify various graphical icons and visual indicators such as radio buttons, dropdown, calendar, checkboxes, text boxes, and more.

Performed manually or with the help of automation tools, GUI tests focus on examining the functionality and components of the graphical user interface, ensuring that it meets the requested specifications visible to users. This goal is achieved through the use of various test cases and test scripts.

# GUI Testing Guidelines:
When doing GUI testing, the team of examiners should consider some important guidelines that can help them validate the accuracy of various visual indicators. Here are some important guidelines for GUY testing:

It is very important for the team to examine the components of GUI such as font, size, length, width, and many more.

- Make sure the error messages are displayed correctly.
- Verify font size and readability.
- Check the text alignment.
- Image quality and clarity.
- Check the position of GUI elements for different screen resolutions.
- Verify Terms of Use, Navigation, Data Integrity, etc.
- Different ways to test GUI:

There are basically three important techniques in GUI testing that software testers around the world use to verify the validity of precision and quality of graphical user interface elements. Here are three strategies:

# Manual Based Testing:

Testers manually check all existing graphical elements in a business document. For example, a test can multiply manually (33X5).

# Record and Replay:

This is an automated GUI testing tool; All work is recorded during the test. Recorded actions or tasks are performed with the expected behavior. This can be repeated several times with different data sets, for example.

# Model-based experiments:

These types of experiments act as graphic descriptions (just like science models). This type of test predicts the behavior of the system and this technique efficiently generates test cases. Some strategies are based on charts and decision table models.
