Coaching sessions will be held on our 
[Microsoft Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a732a7f9358af4a37affd3f56a592fbee%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1820c33d-ed0b-4685-9f38-c1b24c841dad&tenantId=f2d61132-f6d6-42d2-b97f-caa2960fb0f7)
from 3:30PM on the days scheduled below. Proctors must arrive 15 minutes ahead to start the meeting. Please note that you will need to log into the 
[PTSA portal](https://rmsptsa.sharepoint.com/sites/MathClub) at least once before you'll be able to access the Teams channel for the first time.

The homework packet may be downloaded [here](/files/Homework%20Packet.pdf). Assignments for the Homework
sessions come from this packet. It is expected that all members will attempt to complete the assignment 
for the week. It will be covered completely in the Homework session.

The Mathcounts Toolkit can be downloaded [here](/files/Mathcounts%20Toolkit.pdf).

_Cancelled_ sessions are in _italics_. If a session is cancelled via email, then that takes precedence over this schedule.
