 1. Even if you’re in a happy, loving, long-term partnership, learn how to have a full life as if on your own. 

Practical adulting things: bills, common repairs, cleaning/laundry, car stuff, going to the doctor, cooking nutritious food

and 

Self-care, liking-yourself things: cultivating hobbies that engage and delight you, sleep hygiene, learning about your likes and dislikes so you can know what YOU want (not just going along with someone else’s choices), treating yourself as kindly as your partner/friend would 

2. Get your financial house in order (savings/investments, budgeting/living within your means, using credit cards responsibly). 

3. Keep a diary/journal. Whether it’s a full accounting of your days or how you’re feeling, a written record of your life may be invaluable to your older (forgetful) self. 

4. It’s (almost) never too late. You may have internalized ideas about when is an appropriate age to do X. The appropriate age is “when you’re ready and want to.” Don’t self-restrict your desires or goals because society (or depictions of society in popular media) says so. 

5. Try stuff! If you don’t like it, you don’t have to keep at it. If you do like it, do it again. If you want to learn more, find enthusiasts and experts to help you. 

(Thank you, OP, for starting the convo! Thanks to all the posters with helpful insights. 😍)
