# Bio

Zhongqun Cheng. I got my PhD in Nanjing University (2011.9-2016.7) and had been a post-doctor in Xiamen University (2016.9-2019.9). My research interests are X-ray Binaries, Globular Clusters (GCs), Stellar Kinetics and Dynamics. Recently, I began to search for X-ray sources of Galactic GCs using archival Chandra X-ray space telescope data. Utilizing X-ray sources as tracing particles, I analyze the mass segregation effect of binaries in GCs and study their relation to cluster dynamical evolution.
