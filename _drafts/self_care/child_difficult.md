 I was just going to say that you can be ‘fuck yes’ up until it slaps you in the face just how hard it is. I’ve worked 6 jobs and 18 hour shifts, run a restaurant without taking a break for *3 months straight*, but at least I got sleep and weekends. And a salary.

A lot of what society has been force feeding women for basically all of modern history is that unless they breed they’re worthless. The way it’s marketed is that having a baby is the best thing in the world and will make all your dreams come true, and I don’t blame the women who give under from that pressure.

Then when the baby is there you find out there’s barely ANY support unless you’re lucky enough to have financial stability, a good partner and reliable social network, plus access to any other medical and emotional support and help you need. I think ‘fuck yes’ women also have regrets sometimes on a dark and rainy day.

I’m just glad to see that today we’re actually starting to rally up and support each other’s choices and have room to make that decision without being judged to death.
