**VIRTUAL FUR SQUARED 2021&nbsp; VOLUNTEERS**

Are you Interested in making a difference with our growing convention? Fur Squared is staffed entirely by volunteers. Won't you help us out by volunteering? It's easy, fun and there are some great benefits to pitching in. There are plenty of opportunities available for all of our attendees.

**Virtual Warm & Fuzzies**\:&nbsp; Finding your way around a large virtual space in unfamiliar territory can be baffling; especially in a virtual world as large as this one. People always have questions, ranging from where and when panels are, to how to get in touch with staff, and even to making restaurant recommendations. If you like helping people, and making your fellow furries convention experience as stress-free as possible, we can use your help.

**Virtual Duties As Assigned:** Filling in for staff for those unforeseen events which invariably come up, or just pitching in for odd jobs as they arise.&nbsp;

While we know we're going to need help for a virtual Fur Squared, we don't yet know how it's going to work out\! Watch out for updates on this site as well as on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fursquared). In the meantime, you can email us at [volunteers@fursquared.com](mailto:volunteers@fursquared.com)
