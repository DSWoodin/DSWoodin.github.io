With 20+ years of experience in machine learning in both industry and academia, my roles varied from a Software Developer, Lead Applications Developer, IT Consultant, Research Staff and Senior Lecturer. One element that stayed constant is <b>Public Speaking</b> and <i>“getting the message delivered”</i>.

I love creating content, delivering it through presentations and talks and raising awareness. I’m passionate about helping developers' communities get the most out of their software tools and applications. I share my content on my social media links below.
