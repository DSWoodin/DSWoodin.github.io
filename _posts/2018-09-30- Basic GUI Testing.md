Previously, performance optimization meant only server-side optimization. Because most of the websites were static and their processes were done on the server side.
However, with the advent of Web 2.0 technology, web applications have become more dynamic. As a result, client-side code performance has become an important requirement.

# What is GUI Testing

Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is usually a process to verify the expected performance of visual elements such as text, images, buttons, as well as their functional accuracy.
By testing the graphical user interface, the testing team can verify various graphical icons and visual indicators such as radio buttons, dropdown, calendar, checkboxes, text boxes, and more.

Performed manually or with the help of automation tools, GUI tests focus on examining the functionality and components of the graphical user interface, ensuring that it meets the requested specifications visible to users. This goal is achieved through the use of various test cases and test scripts.

# GUI Testing Guidelines:

When doing GUI testing, the team of examiners should consider some important guidelines that can help them validate the accuracy of various visual indicators. Here are some important guidelines for GUY testing:

It is very important for the team to examine the components of GUI such as font, size, length, width, and many more.

- Make sure the error messages are displayed correctly.
- Verify font size and readability.
- Check the text alignment.
- Image quality and clarity.
- Check the position of GUI elements for different screen resolutions.
- Verify Terms of Use, Navigation, Data Integrity, etc.
- Different ways to test GUI:

There are basically three important techniques in GUI testing that software testers around the world use to verify the validity of precision and quality of graphical user interface elements. Here are three strategies:

# Manual Based Testing:

Testers manually check all existing graphical elements in a business document. For example, a test can multiply manually (33X5).

# Record and Replay:

This is an automated GUI testing tool; All work is recorded during the test. Recorded actions or tasks are performed with the expected behavior. This can be repeated several times with different data sets, for example.

# Model-based experiments:

These types of experiments act as graphic descriptions (just like science models). This type of test predicts the behavior of the system and this technique efficiently generates test cases. Some strategies are based on charts and decision table models.

# A Complete Checklist to Check Web Application:

- [x] Test all the mandatory fields should be validated.
- [x] Test the asterisk sign should display for all the mandatory fields.
- [x] All the text should be properly aligned.
- [x] Test the system should not display the error message for optional fields.
- [x] Test that leap years are validated correctly & do not cause errors/miscalculations.
- [x] Test the numeric fields should not accept the alphabets and the proper error message should display.
- [x] Test for negative numbers if allowed for numeric fields.
- [x] Test division by zero should be handled properly for calculations.
- [x] Test the max length of every field to ensure the data is not truncated.
- [x] Test the pop-up message ("This field is limited to 500 characters") should display if the data reaches the maximum size of the field.
- [x] Test that a confirmation message should display for the update and delete operations.
- [x] Test the amount values should display in currency format.
- [x] Test the timeout functionality.
- [x] Test the Sorting functionality.
- [x] Test the functionality of the buttons available
- [x] Scroll bar should appear only if required.
- [x] Test the Privacy Policy & FAQ is clearly defined and should be available for users.
- [x] All fields (Textbox, dropdown, radio button etc) and buttons should be accessible by keyboard shortcuts and the user should be able to perform all operations by using the keyboard.
- [x] Test if any functionality fails the user gets redirected to the custom error page.
- [x] Test all the uploaded documents are opened properly.
