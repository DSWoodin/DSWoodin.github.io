100 percent coverage: it means nothing about the quality of your code or your tests.

When you’re looking at a problem, do it wrong first.

two sources of complexity into necessary and accidental complexity.

10,000 lines of code is the practical limit of program size that a single programmer can understand and maintain.

when a fix doesn’t address the root cause of a problem, the problem usually doesn’t go away at all—it just moves somewhere else.

Two facets to clarity help us reduce accidental software complexity: clarity of thought and clarity of expression.

Source code is not your to-do list or bug database.

Michael Feathers’ [[Working Effectively with Legacy Code]] [Fea04] is the definitive text on dealing with legacy code. If you’re working on a big legacy project, this is the book for you.
On a more tactical level, Martin Fowler’s [[Refactoring]]: Improving the Design of Existing Code [FBBO99] is helpful for anyone maintaining code over time.

This is what a profiler does: it tells you how many times each function is called and how much time is spent in each function.

Consider the website programmer who builds a site with a shopping cart, then another, then another…twenty web sites later, he’s paying the bills OK, but is he actually learning anything?

[[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]]

The idiom of a language moves you toward thinking about your program in the way the language’s designers intended.

Build
(examples: Ant, Maven, Make, Rake)

don’t ever let your career and happiness slide because someone else didn’t take charge.

If you make a change, “try on” your new style starting on a Saturday. That gives you a few days out of the office to get used to it. Monday might shock some of your co-workers, but the key is it won’t shock you

Visibility may sound like shameless self-promotion. Yes, to a degree it is. But when the next job opening comes up or the next cool project is getting started, don’t you want a shot? If your name has been circulating among the managers because of something cool you did, you’re much more likely to get that shot.

There are five major buckets to fill.
Quality

can show you’re writing solid code: defect rate per line of code, bugs fixed, test cases written, and such. They don’t need to be hard measures: positive comments from co-workers, design principles you started applying, or improvements you’ve made to your team’s test infrastructure are all helpful.
Examples: “Fixed forty-two product defects, including five severity-one defects.” “Consistently unit-tested code, with 2:1 average test case to application code ratio.”
Quantity 
Fortunately, quantities are easier to measure: features completed, product releases shipped, source code commits, and so forth, are good fodder. Don’t forget the version control system; it can give you lots of statistics about what you’ve changed in the code base.
Also, keep in mind that code is only part of your job. Anything that benefits the business is worth considering
Examples: “Shipped version 1.2 of Widget Factory in my role as a widget programmer.” “Assisted customer support, providing key information to resolve four support tickets.”
Timeliness 
You don’t get assignments without an expectation of when you’ll get it finished. Track your hit rate and—assuming it’s not terrible—report it in your self-review. This is much easier in agile environments where you review progress every couple weeks.
Examples: “Delivered on project commitments with 82 percent success rate.” ”Completed tasks within 70 percent of original estimates.”
Cost Savings to Company 
Programmers have a reputation for driving costs up rather than down. However, managers are always looking for ways to stretch their budgets, so if you have something to brag about here, brag.
Examples: “Improved message handling capability from 100 emails/second to 150 emails/second, thus making better use of company servers.” “Compressed data in less-used database columns, reducing storage footprint by 42 percent with negligible impact to performance.”

Making the Team Look Good 
Your team’s value within the company isn’t just an equation like revenue contribution vs. cost. Perception counts just as much as any numbers. Any kudos you bring in for the team—and therefore your manager—are worth mentioning.
Examples: “Analyzed web server logs and identified top bounce pages; improved these pages and increased visitor retention.” “Improved GUI look-and-feel before important trade show, earning positive comments from company representatives at the show.”

When it hits writing—email counts—that’s management’s way of creating the paper trail they need to fire somebody.

In your own work, the mushin mind-set means acting and reacting to the pressures of the job with neither defeat nor anger but instead as a consummate professional.

The young bucks spending their lives at the office aren’t always that productive—the office becomes a place of socialization and recreation in addition to work;

Some people are hubs that have connections to a lot of others.

gatekeeper, a person who has a strong and unique connection to a key figure.

pulse-taker, one who’s on the periphery but knows a lot about what’s going on.

Taking on gnarly problems is how you build your expertise and credibility within the team. Sticking with easy parts of the project doesn’t.

The only unacceptable practice is floundering on your own, not asking for help.

The litmus test is that the laptop must make the meeting more efficient rather than less.

Can you clarify the desired outcome of the meeting?

Programmers are great at dwelling on problems because, frankly, it’s easy. Coming up with solutions—even if they don’t pan out—requires talent.

So, don’t get discouraged when you enter the workforce with wide eyes and idealism, only to get some role you think is crummy. You won’t be there forever; you just need to work your way to the role you want.

One thing to keep in mind is that talking to the average salesperson requires some bravado. They speak boldly and confidently—again, that’s what they do best—so it’s easy for them to dominate the conversation. If you’re not so outgoing, toughen up and don’t let their bluster intimidate you.

if you have a problem with a co-worker, do not go to HR first. When HR is notified of a conflict, it starts a process rolling that can spiral way past your intent. Talk to the co-worker or your manager instead.

In practice, engineering gets slack on quality—especially whole-system integration—because they assume the test phase will shake out the bugs.

Done includes development, integration, test, and documentation.

Long hours on a regular basis is a formula for burnout.

call driving spikes. It’s a form of research where you go deep but narrow, usually for the purpose of evaluating a new technology or possibility.

Programmers are always tempted to add one more feature or fix one more bug. We don’t want to let the product out the door because we keep thinking of ways to make it better. Management, on the other hand, always wants to ship one day sooner.

focus your creativity on where your program is different from the other stuff out there.

A common complaint is “You have to run just to stay in the same place.” It can be frustrating trying to keep pace with the world changing around you—especially when you’re trying to keep customers happy and build the next version of the product at the same time.

and be prepared for a new job search if your company turns poisonous.

stick up for the features in proportion to the value they’d give the customer.

Robert Fritz, in his book The Path of Least Resistance [Fri89], identifies two structures for how we interact with our world.

There’s absolutely nothing deceitful about evangelism; it’s just painting a picture of a better future state so that others can understand it and believe in it. Terence Ryan’s Driving Technical Change [Rya10] is a great resource for learning this skill. Guy Kawasaki, one of Apple’s early evangelists, gives a big-picture view of evangelism in his book Selling the Dream [Kaw92].

If you struggled in school, consider that the way they taught may not match the way you naturally learn.

My personal bellwether is watching recently published books—the paper kind—since publishers are looking for the same sweet spot.

School provides a tremendous support structure for students. It has your peers, professors, and a huge library to help back you up. Your day job, on the other hand, is geared toward shipping it. It’s up to you to build the support structure you need for learning.

If meetings and office politics drive you crazy, management is not your path.

You should only look at graduate school for these reasons: you want a break from industry, you want to go into teaching, or you want to go into research.
