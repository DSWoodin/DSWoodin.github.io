 [The Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio](http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Pillars-Investing-Portfolio/dp/0071747052)

The four pillars that the book covers are: 

* theory (risk and return, theory of interest, efficient markets, etc.)
* history (past bubbles and crashes)
* psychology (herd mentality, mistakes that investors make, etc.)
* business (why index funds are awesome, and how to avoid getting ripped off by stock brokers or expensive mutual funds)

It also focuses on portfolio management: diversification, asset allocation with index funds, rebalancing, retirement planning, etc. So it's a fairly comprehensive book, but is an easy read for someone new to investing.
