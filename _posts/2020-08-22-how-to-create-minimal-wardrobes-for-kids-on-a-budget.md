Minimal living and wardrobes for kids on a budget? How does that even work? We have four kids so, I mean, that’s a lot of kids. It’s been important for us to figure out sustainable, not breaking the bank ways to have wadrobes for all of them. On the blog today, I’m sharing about how to create minimal wardrobes for kids without breaking the budget.![An image of my son's closet with boxes up above.](/uploads/20200722_215357_0000_compress16-1.jpg "wadrobe")

## Shop your home.

Oftentimes, we’ve found we’ve had more than enough in our own home. Either from older siblings or from clothes packed away or just extra laying around. Check to see what’s in the closet and make do with what’s there first. Shopping your home for creating minimalist wardrobes for your kids will help you save money long term! Seeing what's there first will also prevent you from buying anything you may already have.

## Reduce what’s needed.

In the past, I thought I needed more clothes because our closets were nearly empty often, but it was because our clothes were waiting patiently - clean in the laundry room. I didn’t need to fill our closets, I just needed to just put them away or get clothes from the [baskets](https://amzn.to/3eUBNWl) when we needed clothes. No guilt in that! I went from a ginormous mountain of clothes to a more reasonable sized one. And then also started to work on a more streamlined laundry routine too. A nice side benefit of that.

## Hand me downs.

If you look hard enough, you will find people giving away clothes. How often did I just drop off at the thrift store when if I had a friend ask me, I’d much rather give to a friend who needed some hand me down clothes than donate? Asking around never hurts, right?! I sometimes ask around on Facebook when I’m looking for something like this.

## Host clothing swap parties when it’s not a pandemic.

I hosted a mega clothing and stuff swap party years back for a bunch of my mom friends that filled our whole basement. I was set for a long time for my kids for clothes! Everyone left happy and we had a great time too.

You can find also more general tips [here](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/thin-closet/) too from Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist website that you may find helpful. Also Courtney Carver’s book [Project 333](https://amzn.to/2ZdURKp) on developing minimalist wardrobes may be helpful too.
