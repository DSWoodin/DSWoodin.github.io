### My story

My name is **Rodrigo Alejandro Vargas Hern√°ndez**. I was born in the great Mexico city in the late 80s.
Like any other Mexican kid, I grew up playing soccer. However, as I got older and "*wiser*" my taste for sports changed, and I fall in love with cycling and basketball.

I did my undergraduate at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) where I got my degree in Chemistry. While doing my undergraduate I found out that my main interest was not in experimental chemistry but rather in the simulation of chemical reactions with computers.
This made me move to Vancouver, Canada to pursue my Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor R. Krems. 
During my Ph.D., I found two new passions that changed my life, cycling, and machine learning. The latter became the main topic of my research career.
