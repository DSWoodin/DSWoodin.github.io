title: About me
---

My name is Nael Alismail. I'm an application architect which is just another way of saying I'm an -old- experienced programmer. I currently work for SOLTECH, Inc. in Atlanta, GA. I spend my time with my family, writing code, and trying my best to play my keyboard. This blog is  to document my thoughts, my diversions and my discoveries. I'm passionate about good code, helping developers grow, great music and Arabic food. 

### my history

I grew up in Birmingham, AL and graduated from UAB in MIS. I've spent some time working in Austin, TX & Pensaolca, FL and most recently, Atlanta, GA.
