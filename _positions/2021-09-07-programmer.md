The Hall Lab is seeking highly motivated individuals with a background in computer science, information technology, human genetics, epidemiology, 
statistical genetics, big data, genomics, metabolomics, and/or bioinformatics for a Programmer/Analyst position at The Pennsylvania State University.

in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodevelopmental/psychiatric disorders, and pharmacogenomic traits. The approaches 
we explore involve the development and application of statistical and computational methods with a focus on the detection of gene-gene interactions, 
gene-environment interactions, phenotyping with advanced imaging analytics, integrating genomic and metabolomics data, and network and/or pathway effects 
associated with human disease. Programmer/Analysts in the Hall Lab use big-data expertise, programing abilities, and critical thinking skills to solve 
complex issues as well as identify new and innovative uses of available data. Additionally, Programmer/Analysts perform and supervise complex data extraction, 
troubleshoot software issues, utilize existing – and develop novel - software to support research activities. Major Duties and Responsibilities: Design, develop, 
test, debug, install, implement, modify and support new or existing software in accordance with standard practices; collaborate with research staff, students, 
postdocs, and PI in development and implementation of software; work with users to analyze their requirements; prepare test plans and write documentation; 
demonstrate programming skills (e.g., R, Python, C, SQL, SAS, C++), data visualization and interpretation skills; investigate data and/or program problems; 
determine source of problem; take corrective action; demonstrate ability to work independently on multiple projects simultaneously; maintain familiarity with 
installed software standards and procedures and evaluate other tools to determine the appropriate fit into application development; provide technical guidance 
to other staff; demonstrate the ability to work effectively in a team environment as well as interface with all levels of staff/management within and beyond 
Penn State; work well in a collaborative environment within a diverse workforce; establish and maintain best software engineering and design practices; 
integrate more complex elements and technological advances into work assignments for overall technical leadership; provide formal technical liaison with 
other departments and organizations to integrate University-wide, national, and/or international technologies and services; implement, review progress and 
evaluate results on moderately complex work assignments; may be responsible for various administrative and budget tasks. Education and/or 
Experience: At least four years of experience as a programmer/analyst and Bachelor’s degree or higher, or an equivalent combination of education and experience,
