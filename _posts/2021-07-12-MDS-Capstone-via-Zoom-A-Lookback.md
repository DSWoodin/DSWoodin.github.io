# MDS Capstone via Zoom: A lookback

Hello dear reader,

This blogpost aims to share some of our learnings from the MDS Capstone project. If youâ€™re a new student or a current student reading this after completing your block 6 coursework, congratulations! We wish you the very best in your capstone journey and hope that some of the following tips might serve you well during your project. Put on your data science hats and read on!

## Project Management
### Have a realistic timeline, give a buffer for your intended timeline

8-weeks for capstone projects is double the time of your earlier group projects in MDS, and it may make you think you have more time. However, more often than not, people tend to overestimate their productivity. Furthermore, from our experience, the first week for the hackathon and the last two weeks for presentation, testing & documentation went by much quicker than we realized, hence the core time for the project development was actually around 5 weeks.
