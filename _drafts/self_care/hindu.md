 Piggy backing off of this, I struggled to call myself Hindu because I only enjoyed the festivals but didn’t find any significance in the Poojas and the Hindu traditions of olden days. Turns out all of that stuff is just as valid. My grandmother had this to say when I told her if I was cheating hinduism by not really believing in gods but taking part in these festivals which celebrated them. 

Her response: “but you already do? The belief in a god is not the belief in a literal magical being that has created our world and dictates the everyday ongoing s of it. It’s a belief in the idea of a righteous path. The many gods who fought and differ in their ways of thinking not only show you that there isn’t only one righteous path but also that your moral ground may be very different from others but these stories and these texts help us understand what might be a common moral ground. You celebrating the return of Ram from his vanvaas only demonstrates your belief in the brave and strong being triumphant over the obstacles they face. You show me how brave you are when you tell me about the way you adapted to America. You show the same spirit of perseverance as Ram did. Your brother’s antics and your patience with him show the same very special relationship that Krishna and Balrama showed. These stories are merely examples of life that seemed to have those key components of our common morality. They showed the values that Hindus give high regard to. So when you participate “only” in these festivals it doesn’t negate your belief of Hinduism. It doesn’t make you not-Hindu. Stories are just stories, to be Hindu is to hold the core values of morality close to you. And if I’m being honest some of these core values are so common sense that even a non-Hindu could be a Hindu.” (That last point seems moot these day’s with crazies running the government here in the US But I digress)

This is a rough translation and I may have missed some points but she told me this two years ago when I asked her why she’s up at 4am every morning to do Pooja when so much bad has happened, and Then I asked if I should tell my parents I’m not Hindu and she told me why I thought I wasn’t and boom^^^

It seems to resonate a lot with what you’ve said in your comment.
