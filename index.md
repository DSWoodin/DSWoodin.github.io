**I am** a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto in professor P. Brumers' group. I am also an associate postdoctoral researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/about/).
I did my PhD in professor [R. Krems' group](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/krems/) at the University of British Columbia. The main topic of my research is applications.

**My current research topics are** applications of *automatic differentiation* to optimize energy transport systems under natural light, and the construction of more accurate *potential energy surfaces* using Gaussian processes.

**I was borned** in Mexico city, and I lived a couple of years in Vancouver during my graduate studies. In the summer of 2019, I moved to Toronto to continue my academic carrear. 
In my spare time I usually practice *bike&beer*, choose a craft brewery and cycle there. Before the pandemic I used to play basketball too.
