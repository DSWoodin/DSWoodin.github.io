My name is Josemy Duarte. I am a Software Engineer with a particular interest in technologies related to backend, cloud and devops. For more information about my professional career you can take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josemyduarte/) or write me an [email](mailto: duarte.josemy@gmail.com) if you have any question.

## A little history...

I grew up in a small town in Venezuela. Since I was little, computers always caught my attention and in the midst of so much interest, added to the curiosity of a teenager, I damaged a few... However, it was not until college that I learned about the *art of programming*. So since 2010 I have been programming for fun and for work.

I am currently at [Unity](https://unity.com/) giving my best, together with a great team, to facilitate the success of game creators.

## What do I like?

I like programming, so I enjoy doing my job and that's also why you will often find me coding on weekends or after hours. I also like traveling and a good day at the beach. Usually, I use my free time to go to the cinema, read books, attend meetups or try any new technology.

## Why a blog?

Because I want to tell my experiences, hoping that someone will find it useful. So if you took the trouble to read this short bio, why don't you take a few minutes to check my posts? Welcome!
