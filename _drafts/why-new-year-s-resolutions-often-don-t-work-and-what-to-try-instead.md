_Do you make resolutions?_ I do. Or, rather, did, but I wanted to try something new this year. I find with resolutions, I often would burn out OR I would have to completely pivot or [scrap it](https://raywilliams.ca/why-we-dont-keep-our-new-years-resolutions-and-what-to-do-about-it/) (which isn't bad in and of itself), but ideally, it'd be nice to have something stick around, wouldn't it? Resolutions can work, yep, but oftentimes, like me, I [BURN OUT](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm#:\~:text=Burnout%20is%20a%20state%20of,unable%20to%20meet%20constant%20demands.).

Today on the blog, I'm sharing about why new year's resolutions often don't work and what to try instead.

## Scrap new year's resolutions and try formation instead.

Instead of resolutions, I'm focusing on "formation": areas of my life I'd like to focus on - _a continuation or a deepening of my own growth vs. a huge overhaul of goals in my life_. Why  do new year's resolutions often don't work for me? I'd burnout from too many goals. Or over the top goals. Or goals that are at step Z, but I'm just needing to go from A to B.

Developing myself into more of...myself, so to speak. _So instead of aiming for an end point of a certain goal, for instance, it's about doing certain actions that points us to where we think we'd like to go_. I'm focusing on five areas to keep it simple this year, but may add more as time goes on. As I also don't see this as a one and done thing, but a continuation.

##### What I'm focusing on for areas of formation this year:

Nutrition

Spiritual life

Relationships (close friends and my husband especially)

Personal growth/education

Creativity/play

##### Other ideas of areas of formation to look at:

Health  
Exercise  
Nutrition

Systems in the home

Organization

Habits

Mental health

Emotional health

Stress management

Learn a new skill

Family life

...the list could go on and your list may be completely different too, such as [the 5 aspects of personal development](http://www.breakthroughpsychologyprogram.com/5-parts-of-personal-development.html).

Perhaps instead of writing new year's resolutions this year, we focus on where we are and where we'd like to go - but not to the moon. The next little step. Or a sidestep to where we left off that we need to pick up. A refocusing of priorities, an intentional list of ATTAINTABLE little actions or tasks to help us move toward where we are and who we are vs someone we are not.

# Maybe it's time to try something a bit different with "resolutions" or new year's goals this year.

New year's resolutions often [don't work](https://www.pocketmindfulness.com/why-you-shouldnt-set-new-years-resolution/) because they are TOO much, many, or unrealistic.

_PS I created_ [_a worksheet for you_](https://mailchi.mp/dc5be4786cb9/unnewyearsresolution) _if you'd like to do this alongside with me, the un new year's resolution worksheet. My Formation Worksheet for 2021 (the un New Yearâ€™s Resolution Worksheet). A spot for you to write down the areas you'd like to work on formation, the action steps, and a spot for notes.
