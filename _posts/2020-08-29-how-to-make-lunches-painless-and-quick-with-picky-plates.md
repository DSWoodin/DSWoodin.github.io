I’m home full time and when there is no pandemic around, I’m responsible for all meals in the home. So I value quick, easy, and healthy. The less thinking I have to do, the better! We eat the same breakfast daily, so wanted something easy for lunch too. No thinking required for lunches too. Enter picky plates. I’ve also heard them called finger food plates too, but like the name “picky plates”. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about how to design a simple system to make your lunches painless and quick with picky plates.

## How I put picky plates together

1\. I wrote up a sheet of finger foods we ate and are accepted by most of our family.

2\. I split them into different categories (such as veggies, fruits, proteins).

3\. When it’s lunch time, I simply take out my list and pick a variety of foods from different categories. I also have numbers assigned to each category, so I know how many to pick from each (or my kids if they are helping). That's it!
