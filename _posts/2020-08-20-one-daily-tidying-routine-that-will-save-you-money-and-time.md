description: Doing daily laundry and having less in your wardrobe can save you money
  and time.

---
What if I told you that committing to staying on top of laundry would save you money and time. Would you do it? Those are the two benefits I clued into after we started adding laundry to our daily nonnegotiable tidying routine. Today on the blog I’m going to share with you how staying on top of your laundry will also save you both money and time.

## Committing to daily laundry

It sounds simple, but in practice, may not be the easiest. By committing to washing daily, you will notice that you no longer need to have a pile of extra clothes to wear for when you need to get caught up on laundry. So, in turn, that means less clothes to buy and less time spent washing clothes. And for us? A HUGE bonus has been that there are fewer stray socks around my house now too. So I’ll take it. Ha!

## Where to start

* Purge and downsize. If you’re wanting to create a simple laundry routine for yourself and start saving money and time, the first thing to do to make it easier on yourself is to purge and downsize clothes that you no longer wear, fit, or are irreparable.
* Inspect clothes as you go. I did a big purge a while ago, but constantly maintenance purge when I’m doing the laundry. I inspect clothes as they go through the laundry routine.
* See how much access clothes there are after you’ve established your daily laundry routine. This will give you an idea of how much excess you really do have.

_Your laundry routine is going to look different from mine, but hopefully looking at mine will give you a good place to start. And if your wardrobe needs a total rehaul and you have a hard time knowing where to start, you may enjoy my Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide. Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” Want to know more about how I fine tuned my whole wardrobe and follow along the simple steps?
