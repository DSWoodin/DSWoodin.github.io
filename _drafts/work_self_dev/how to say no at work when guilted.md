> "I wouldn't have asked if I didn't really need it"

I would counter with, "Hey coworker, I know you probably don't mean to do this but it puts me in a really difficult situation when you respond like that. I need you to trust that I wouldn't have said no if I didn't really need to say no. I will definitely try to help you out as much as possible but I can't this time".
