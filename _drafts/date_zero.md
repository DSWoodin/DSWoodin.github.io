 In my experience as a guy, the ladies I dated from apps/sites felt much safer if you treated meeting someone in person as "date zero", meaning it wasn't necessarily a full romantic date, but rather going to a super public place like a coffee shop or something and greeting each other, sussing out what level of killer the other person is, etc.

Plenty of those dates turned into a first date where we talked for many, many hours or got dinner. I had one "date zero" that lasted not even two hours before she took off, and we ended up dating for a good long time and broke up very amicably.

I'm a huge fan of the "date zero" concept.
