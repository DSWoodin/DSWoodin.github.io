 By discovering the depth. It was difficult for me to see the point in high lit like John Updike or Herman Melville until I started to recognize symbol and theme. Then this stuff becomes like a cosmic drama hidden behind the page. You don't enjoy the Bible as literature because it's Tolkeinesque with magic and dwarves and shit, you enjoy it as literature because you start to recognize deep reverberating themes that relate to our own lives: God parts the waters, Moses parts the waters, Joshua parts the waters, Elijah parts the waters; all of these are echoes of each other that speak to the experience of birth; seeing the thread of meaning becomes life affirming, and colors the rest of the book. Until someone sees that high literature contains a deeper string of meaning, they'll end up just reading stuff that titillates.

Let me put it like this (I've put a lot of thought into this stuff; [my buddy ended up writing an essay about it](http://www.kyleschen.com/2017/04/11/what-do-you-want-to-want/)): There is a scale in life I'll call the hedonic/[eudaimonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) scale. It works like this: Purely hedonic pleasures are surface pleasures that require very little effort on the part of the user to enjoy. Eudaimonic pleasures are the ones that require more effort. As a result, eudaimonic pleasures tend to be fuller, more lasting, engage more of our bodies, mind, and experience. But they're a slower burn.

Hedonic ===============================> Eudaimonic

Reductive ==============================> Holistic

Easy ==================================> Difficult

The thing about fantasy/genre lit is that it's fairly easy to enjoy (I enjoy it myself). But there's a state of mind called [Sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)) that Eudaimonic stuff tends to get us to: a deeper sense of life and the universe. It only really ever comes through deep engagement with something that ends up rewiring your insides. This is not at all something that everyone feels like putting the effort into enjoying. Every book is a bet: you bet your time and effort on the book giving back to you something approaching entertainment or enjoyment. If you can't see that it will be entertaining at first glance, you won't bet on it. And it's hard to see that high lit will be rewarding at first because breaking into it is difficult as hell. Once you have, though, it slowly gets easier and it becomes a high you chase, like exercise.

I've often wondered how to get more people engaged with deep high literature like this. I ended up building an entire web app devoted to it: [anno.wiki](https://anno.wiki). The purpose of the app is to allow anyone to annotate any part of a book, to explain deeper symbolism like this, so more people can experience it. There's already tons of annotated literature that does it, but it's never exhaustive or interactive, so I wanted to create the Wikipedia of Annotations. But it hasn't quite caught on. That might just be a matter of time, but I have virtually no connections to schools of any kind, and not much money for marketing.
