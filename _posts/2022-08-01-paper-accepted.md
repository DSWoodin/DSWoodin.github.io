Congrats to Dr. Lauren Hoskovec for earning honorable mention in the ENVR Student Paper Competition for
the Joint Statistical Meetings 2021 for this work!

Exposure to air pollution is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recent
technological advancements permit the collection of time-resolved personal exposure data.
Such data are often incomplete with missing observations and exposures below the limit of
detection, which limit their use in health effects studies. In this paper we develop an infinite
hiddenMarkov model for multiple asynchronous multivariate time series with missing
data. Our model is designed to include covariates that can inform transitions among hidden
states. We implement beam sampling, a combination of slice sampling and dynamic
programming, to sample the hidden states, and a Bayesian multiple imputation algorithm
to impute missing data. In simulation studies, our model excels in estimating hidden states
and state-specific means and imputing observations that are missing at random or below
the limit of detection. We validate our imputation approach on data from the Fort Collins
Commuter Study. We show that the estimated hidden states improve imputations for data
that are missing at random compared to existing approaches. In a case study of the Fort
Collins Commuter Study, we describe the inferential gains obtained from our model including
improved imputation of missing data and the ability to identify shared patterns in
activity and exposure among repeated sampling days for individuals and among distinct
individuals.
