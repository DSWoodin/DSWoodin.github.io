 I was in last sem of my engineering and was doing an internship in Coimbatore this March. My friend's dad who works higher up in UP govt, strictly called him back citing covid (this was 15th March, around 300 cases in India) to his home in Gorakhpur and booked his next day flight ticket.

I felt that was just reckless to leave internship in the middle and go back to hometown due to something that seemed so trivial at that time, there were hardly more than 300 cases throughout india, my friend said that there's gonna be a strict lockdown with transportation shut down in coming few weeks, while I was thinking pragmatically, I couldn't fathom govt shutting down railways and airlines, even then that was too stupid and moronic for me. 

After my friend left, my dad forced me to come back to my hometown, I took a flight back on 20 March. And voila to my sheer surprise govt did close of everything and shutdown the whole nation. For fucking 21 days at first, I was just trying to imagine the plight of those stuck far from their homes in such an tensed atmosphere, there was no way to get back.

The whole lockdown fiasco became so unbearable when poor destitute migrant labours started to walk back to their towns and villages. I wondered for whom they were doing this? For a privileged few who were sitting and earning from home and praising such a draconian governmental overreach?

There was no major call for justice for migrant labourers, who had to walk thousands of kilometres in summer heat while millions of public buses and trains were sitting idle, I honestly expected that exodous to generate huge outcry like we saw during CAA/NRC, and why not similar to CAA/NRC that was a sheer violation of human dignity and rights.
Alas, everyone was silent, enjoying in their comfortable rooms with air conditioner set to maximum.


That whole migrant episode made me so ashamed of my privileges (even though I only have a few), insensitivity of Indian society and even those helpless migrants who agreed that their fate was to walk down thousands of kilometres in 2020. 

Plastic people, plastic government and a plastic nation!
