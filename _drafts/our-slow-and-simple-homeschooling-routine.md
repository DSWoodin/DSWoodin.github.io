I'm always looking for simpler ways to do life, whether it be reducing clutter or streamlining our days as a family. Sometimes I make things harder than it is. One area of my life that needed some streamlining was the way I showed up on social media. My planning and content essentially. I was well on the way, but a recent course I took helped consolidate and simplify everything for me even more. Today on my blog, I'm sharing with you my Instagram review on Erica Fraser's [How I Grew My Instagram to 33, 000](https://digital.mombreak.ca/howigrewmyinstagram/26mcq) course, that I went through a couple months ago.

_Here's an overview of what the course offers, quoted from her_ [_website_](https://github.com/kellymbriggs/hydeout-jekyll-starter/blob/master/_posts/www.mombreak.ca)_:_

> This is a mini-series where I share with you guys EXACTLY what I did to grow to 33,000 Instagram followers in 3 years (_no holding back, get the inside scoop!_).
>
> # **What to Expect**
>
> Have you ever looked at what people are doing online and thought, _"I wish I could sit with them and they'd just tell me everything they've done to get to this point?"._
>
> Well, that's what I'm doing in this mini-series!
>
> What's in this Mini-Series?
>
> This is a mini-series that will walk you through a story of exactly what I did:

> * How the account got started
> * Did I use pods?
> * Did I buy followers?
> * What's helped me grow the fastest?
> * What would I do again?
> * What would I skip next time?
> * Do a lot of people buy followers?
> * Do a lot of people buy engagement?

## My review of her course

Erica broke things down in quick, simple units of study. They were so clear and easy to apply. The pace of it was perfect for the busy mom, like me. I also could easily listen to it with headphones on if I needed as the way she taught was so clear and easy to follow. What I appreciate the most, over many other people putting together courses like this is that Erica is a digital marketing strategist with over ten years in her day job, so comes from that background of experience as well. I can trust her tips and suggestions.

## Who is this course for?

So essentially, if you are on Instagram and are frustrated with it or just want to know more about how it all works broken down in a simple way as well as grow your account, Erica's course is for you.

Check out [How I Grew My Instagram to 33, 000](https://digital.mombreak.ca/howigrewmyinstagram/26mcq) if that all sounds helpful to you too. It was well worth my investment and I've noticed a difference since I tweaked some of the things I learned from her too as well as the tips she shares on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/mom.break) with her close friends list. You can also read more reviews and see a video clip before purchasing.
