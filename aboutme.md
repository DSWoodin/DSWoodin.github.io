Hello reader!

My name is Julian Kock. I study Computer Science AP at [UCL University College](https://www.ucl.dk/international).

On my 4th semester I'm going to specialize myself into two different areas of Computer Science and Software Development.

Those two areas are:

**Software Architecture including Clean Architecture and Microservice Architecture.**

**Full stack web development in .NET Core and Angular.**

On this site you can follow my learning process and see my results. Parallel to my learning process I will be making a project for [Ordbogen](https://www.ordbogen.com/). A Danish company who specializes in language specific applications such as dictionaries etc. On this website you will also be given access to my repositories and read about the project alongside my learning process.

I hope you enjoy your stay.

Best regards
Julian
