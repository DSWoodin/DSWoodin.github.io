[Fur Squared 2021 Programming Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyityVtVgjGDCrMGnhGa1CNRl9TbzaXmGRzf258VIVQOifGQ/viewform){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

### What's different this year?

We're virtual\! We're online\! We **WILL NOT** be at the hotel (please don't show up there). Instead, panels will be streamed online for all to watch\! Additionally, the virtual format gives us the option for a new type of programming: prerecorded panels\!

### What's a prerecorded panel?

A prerecorded panel is a panel that you will film and edit prior to the convention, and that will then be aired in its entirety. The final version of your prerecorded panel will need to be submitted no later than Friday, January 15, but once your panel is approved you can submit any version you're happy with and our programming staff will be able to offer feedback or suggestions.

### How much editing will Fur Squared do for me?

Unfortunately, Fur Squared doesn't have the resources to do any editing on prerecorded panels more involved than minor runtime adjustments.

### Will I need VRChat to watch panels?

No, you will not need VRChat to watch panels. Panels will be streamed via popular online streaming services (such as YouTube or Twitch) and available for everyone with Internet access to watch.

### Why do panels have weird times this year?

This year we're asking panelists to end their panels 10 minutes earlier than normal. This will allow us to have theming, charity, or other miscellaneous content between panels, as well as provide a cushion in case we experience technical difficulties.

### What about gaming tournaments or TTRPG games?

Given the virtual nature of this year's con, we want to include expanded video and tabletop gaming tracks. We are considering creating a separate submission form for such events, but for now please submit them via the normal programming form.

### When will I hear back about my submission?

We'll start reviewing panel submissions as soon as we can. Once we review your submission, you'll receive an email letting you know if your submission was approved or denied. Prerecorded panels will receive priority evaluation to give panelists as much lead time as possible to record and submit their panels.

### What technical requirements are there for panels (e.g. file type, streaming setup, etc.)?

We are still working to finalize the technical requirements for both live and prerecorded panels. We will update this page once we finalize those requirements, and will notify all submitted panelists via email at that time. If you have submitted a panel and cannot meet the technical requirements when they are established, don't worry\! You are free to withdraw at that time. Just email us at [programming@fursquared.com](mailto:programming@fursquared.com).

### Is there a deadline to submit programming?

We do not currently have a deadline set, but traditionally the deadline has been no later than the end of the calendar year. We anticipate this deadline may be moved earlier this year due to the additional complexities of running a virtual event. We will update this page with a date when it is announced.
