 I don’t think it’s necessarily that. I spent a lot of time ‘friendzoned’ when I was younger, and what I’ve come to realize with the benefit of retrospect is that I wasn’t led on, I actively lied about my intentions to the object of my attraction, every time I sensed the conversation was going in a direction that might sever the connection. I would just say whatever I thought might postpone that decision. Everything I would say in those circumstances was a lie designed to hold onto the hope that one day her feelings would become something more. 

When guys are in the friendzone it’s not the girl that’s leading the guy on by sharing intimacy that the guy can only assosciate with romance, it’s the guy leading the girl on by pretending he can receive this intimacy platonically when he knows he cannot.
