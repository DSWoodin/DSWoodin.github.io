If interesested in any of these postions contact **Dr. Molly Hall** [mah546@psu.edu] with CV and cover letter.

## Programmer Analyst 3/4

The Hall Lab is seeking highly motivated individuals with a background in computer science, information technology, human genetics, epidemiology, 
statistical genetics, big data, genomics, metabolomics, and/or bioinformatics for a Programmer/Analyst position at The Pennsylvania State University. 
Research in our group is highly dynamic, with broad research opportunities for exploring the genetic and environmental architecture of complex traits 
in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodevelopmental/psychiatric disorders, and pharmacogenomic traits. The approaches 
we explore involve the development and application of statistical and computational methods with a focus on the detection of gene-gene interactions, 
gene-environment interactions, phenotyping with advanced imaging analytics, integrating genomic and metabolomics data, and network and/or pathway effects 
associated with human disease. Programmer/Analysts in the Hall Lab use big-data expertise, programing abilities, and critical thinking skills to solve 
complex issues as well as identify new and innovative uses of available data. Additionally, Programmer/Analysts perform and supervise complex data extraction, 
troubleshoot software issues, utilize existing – and develop novel - software to support research activities. Major Duties and Responsibilities: Design, develop, 
test, debug, install, implement, modify and support new or existing software in accordance with standard practices; collaborate with research staff, students, 
postdocs, and PI in development and implementation of software; work with users to analyze their requirements; prepare test plans and write documentation; 
demonstrate programming skills (e.g., R, Python, C, SQL, SAS, C++), data visualization and interpretation skills; investigate data and/or program problems; 
determine source of problem; take corrective action; demonstrate ability to work independently on multiple projects simultaneously; maintain familiarity with 
installed software standards and procedures and evaluate other tools to determine the appropriate fit into application development; provide technical guidance 
to other staff; demonstrate the ability to work effectively in a team environment as well as interface with all levels of staff/management within and beyond 
Penn State; work well in a collaborative environment within a diverse workforce; establish and maintain best software engineering and design practices; 
integrate more complex elements and technological advances into work assignments for overall technical leadership; provide formal technical liaison with 
other departments and organizations to integrate University-wide, national, and/or international technologies and services; implement, review progress and 
evaluate results on moderately complex work assignments; may be responsible for various administrative and budget tasks. Education and/or 
Experience: At least four years of experience as a programmer/analyst and Bachelor’s degree or higher, or an equivalent combination of education and experience, 
is desired. Programming abilities, such as python and C++, are desired. This is a fixed-term appointment funded for one year from date of hire with excellent 
possibility of re-funding.



## Post-Doc Postion

The Hall Lab is seeking highly motivated individuals with a background in Human Genetics, Genetic Epidemiology, Statistical Genetics, Population Genetics, Human Development, Metabolomics, Environmental Science, and/or Bioinformatics for postdoctoral positions at The Pennsylvania State University. Research in our group is highly collaborative, with broad research opportunities for exploring the genetic and environmental architecture of complex traits in humans, including diabetes, neurodevelopmental/psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular health, childhood health outcomes. The approaches we explore involve the development and application of statistical and computational methods with a focus on the detection of gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, deep phenotyping with advanced imaging and image analytics, integrating genomic and metabolomics data, and network and/or pathway effects associated with human disease. Skills and abilities: The ideal candidate will have a desire to work within a team and will have strong scientific written, verbal, and electronic communication skills, such as manuscript writing and scientific presentation skills. Additionally, candidates must have: Experience manipulating large-scale data (e.g. genetic, environment, metabolomics, phenome); Familiarity with bioinformatics tools and databases for the analysis of results; Record of peer-reviewed publications; Statistical analysis experience using R, SAS, or STATA required and programming abilities such as python or perl are desired. Education and Experience: Ph.D. degree in the area of Genetic Epidemiology, Human Genetics, Statistical Genetics, Biology, Biostatistics, Mathematics, Population Genetics, Human Development, Metabolomics, and/or Bioinformatics or M.D with appropriate research experience required. The Hall Lab at Penn State University is focused on building tools to elucidate the complex genetic and environmental underpinnings of human disease. We integrate genetic and exposure (derived from surveys and metabolomics methods) big data to predict disease status. The ultimate goals of this work are to enrich our understanding of the complex mechanisms that lead to common disease and provide methods to identify those most at risk of disease (based on their genetic and exposure backgrounds) in a clinical setting.
