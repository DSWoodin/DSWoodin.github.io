Besides being a dream for micromanagers, it seems to be more about signalling progress vs. actually making progress.

just don't get it why developers like Scrum. The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the "product owner" concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives "them" total control over my workday while I have no idea what "they" are doing the whole day. Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I'm much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning. If I want to spend 3 days learning a new framework that might do the product good, nobody cares. The only thing that counts is the endresult. That means we are beating the product into submission until its good, even if it means rewriting the thing three times and missing deadlines. So no more Scrum for me. Never.
