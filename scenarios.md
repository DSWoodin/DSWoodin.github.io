## Scenarios

### Temporary Forensics Scenario

I am currently hosting a Linux Forensics Scenario for 2 weeks (Closes 31MAR20) - it is hosted at [LinuxCTF](http://45.76.114.244:8000/register)

Please leave some feedback when you finish the last question

I might look at making some forensic's scenarios that could be useful for analysts. For now, please feel free to checkout the excellent tutorials  by [cybercodebear](https://cybercodebear.github.io/blog.html)
