Remote working has become increasingly popular over the years, particularly in the software industry. As someone who has been working with remote teams since 2008, and working from home since 2015, I can attest to the fact that there are both benefits and drawbacks to this style of work. In this article, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of remote working for software-related positions and my visions about future.

**Benefits of Remote Working**

Flexibility: One of the biggest advantages of remote working is the flexibility it provides. When you work remotely, you can set your own schedule and work from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly appealing to those who enjoy traveling or have family obligations. According to the Gartner 2021 Digital Worker Experience Survey, 43% of respondents said that flexibility in working hours helped them achieve greater productivity. 

Increased productivity: Many people find that they are more productive when working remotely. This is because there are fewer distractions and interruptions than in a traditional office setting. Additionally, remote workers often have more control over their environment, which can help them stay focused and motivated. According to a recent study of more than 30,000 US employees, one day per week spent working from home could boost productivity by **4.8%**¹. Another study found that remote workers can save $4,500 on commuting costs annually and that taking breaks throughout the day can help workers stay productive². In a University of Chicago research paper, scientists found that nearly six in ten of their survey respondents reported higher productivity when working remotely, while only 14% proved less productive. On average, remote work productivity was over 7% higher than in-office productivity³.
