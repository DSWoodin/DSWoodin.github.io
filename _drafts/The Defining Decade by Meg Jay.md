Our strong ties feel comfortable and familiar but, other than support, they may have little to offer.

Information and opportunity spread farther and faster through weak ties than through close friends because weak ties have fewer overlapping contacts.

If weak ties do favors for us, they start to like us. Then they become even more likely to grant us additional favors in the future.

altruism has been linked to happiness, health, and longevity—as long as the help we give is not a burden.

Make yourself interesting. Make yourself relevant. Do your homework so you know precisely what you want or need. Then, respectfully, ask for it.

Unthought knowns are those things we know about ourselves but forget somehow.

Part of realizing our potential is recognizing how our particular gifts and limitations fit with the world around us.

Goals direct us from the inside, but shoulds are paralyzing judgments from the outside.

With e-commerce and peer-to-peer marketing we have set aside one-size-fits-all in favor of a “market of one.”

Lock-in is the decreased likelihood to search for other options, or change to another option, once an investment in something has been made.

Switching costs—or the time, money, or effort it requires to make a change—are more complex. When

The stories are often found hiding, as Cathy said, in the gaps between what we plan to do and what we actually do, or between what happens and what we tell people about what happens.

Twentysomethings who don’t feel like they are getting along or getting ahead, on the other hand, feel stressed and angry and alienated—

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut whereby we decide how likely something is based on how easy it is to bring an example to mind.

present bias. People of all ages and walks of life discount the future, favoring the rewards of today over the rewards of tomorrow.

“There is a big difference between having a life in your thirties and starting a life in your thirties.”

Most twentysomethings can’t write the last sentence of their lives, but when pressed, they usually can identify things they want in their thirties or forties or sixties—or things they don’t want—and work backward from there. This is how you have your own multigenerational epic with a happy ending. This is how you live your life in real time.
