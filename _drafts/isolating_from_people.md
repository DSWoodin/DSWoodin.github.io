 It was the same for me, except I realized what I was doing.  I would get so angry that I felt like a different person and I did these things.  It is still the same.  When I get really angry or depressed or sad, I can't remember what I'm like when I'm normal.  Emotionally manipulative, guilt tripping, finding fault...  A lot of it is because I have had my trust broken by many people that I cared for in my life, family and friends.  

During and after, I spent much of my time isolating myself from people, only relying on myself and tending to my own emotional needs.  When it comes to the emotional needs of others, I am inconsiderate.  In order for a relationship to have even a chance of working, one must be considerate, sometimes putting a partner's wishes above their own and listening to their thoughts.  However, the partner must also extend the same consideration.  Consideration, communication, understanding...  There are things I know about relationships, but I can't apply them.

I don't want real friends or a significant other.  It's easy to admit that I'm a coward, and hard to face my fears.  I'm afraid that I won't be able to control my emotions, like countless other times, and end up causing more pointless hurt.  I feel so very sad right now, and my chest hurts too.  I can't say that I don't care about others, because I do care, and that is why I am afraid.  I have been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.. but actually and truly overcoming it, I still am far from reaching that.

Just recently, as of a month or so ago, a person I considered a precious friend, told me that they didn't care about me anymore, even as a friend.  It's a culmination of my own problems and treatment of them that led to them feeling that way, but yet, I can't help and feel as if my heart has been thrown down and stomped on.  I became angry, and told them just how much I hated them, said all kinds of nasty things... but it isn't true.  I am just hurt.  I am tired.  This is the first time I have cried in months after feeling numb and nothing.  I have people who tell me what an amazing person I am, and they think they really know me.. but no.  To say they don't know me at all wouldn't be true, but they don't know the one thing that keeps me from even keeping them close to my heart.
