## Abstract
Two recent papers (Amaro Seoane, 2019; Gourgoulhon et al. 2019) revealed that in our Galaxy, there are very extreme-mass-ratio inspirals composed by brown dwarfs and the supermassive black hole in the center. The event rates they estimated are very considerable for space-borne detectors in the future. However, there are also plunge events during the formation of insprialing orbits. In this work, we calculate the gravitational waves from compact objects (brown dwarf, primordial black hole and etc.) plunging into or being scattered by the center supermassive black hole. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio of these bursts are quite large for space-borne detectors. The event rates are estimated as ∼ 0.01 in one year for the Galaxy. If we are lucky, this kind of very extreme-mass-ratio bursts (XMRBs) will offer a unique chance to reveal the nearest supermassive black hole and nuclei dynamics. The event rate can be as large as 4 ∼ 8 per year in 10 Mpc, and the signal is strong enough for space-borne detectors, then we have a good chance to probe the nature of neighboring black holes.

## Bio
Han Wenbiao, currently a researcher at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a post professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a doctoral tutor. He has been engaged in orbital dynamics and gravitational wave simulation of extreme mass ratio systems for a long time. The proposed EOB-Teukolsky numerical framework has been widely used in extreme mass ratios. Together with the collaborators, he proposed the SEOBNRE model, which is currently the most accurate elliptical binary gravitational wave template, and was used by multiple LIGO teams to search for elliptical binary stars. He has published more than 40 SCI papers and two monographs.

You're welcome to participate this Friday morning!
