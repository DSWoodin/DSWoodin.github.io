One of the major research questions regarding human microbiome
studies is the feasibility of designing interventions that modulate the
composition of the microbiome to promote health and cure disease.
This requires extensive understanding of the modulating factors of
the microbiome, such as dietary intake, as well as the relation between 
microbial composition and phenotypic outcomes, such as body mass index (BMI). 
Previous efforts have modeled these data separately, employing two-step approaches
that can produce biased interpretations of the results. Here, we propose a
Bayesian joint model that simultaneously identifies clinical covariates 
associated with microbial composition data and predicts a phenotypic response using
information contained in the compositional data. Using spike-andslab priors, 
our approach can handle high-dimensional compositional as well as clinical data. 
Additionally, we accommodate the compositional structure of the data via balances 
and overdispersion typically found in microbial samples. We apply our model 
to understand the relations between dietary intake, microbial samples, and BMI. In this
analysis, we find numerous associations between microbial taxa and
dietary factors that may lead to a microbiome that is generally more
hospitable to the development of chronic diseases, such as obesity.
Additionally, we demonstrate on simulated data how our method
outperforms two-step approaches and also present a sensitivity analysis.
