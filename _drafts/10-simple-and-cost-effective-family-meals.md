I love getting meal inspiration from other families just like ours, so thought I'd write down all of our simple and cost effective family meals here for you. Hopefully you find something new to try. Tag me on instagram [@simplehomemom](www.instagram.com/simplehomemom) if you do! I bring you: 10 simple and cost effetive family meals.

#### Why simple and cost effective family meals?

Because life is busy and most of the time kids do better with simple rather than elaborate meals..and plus it means less prep time for us. It's the ideal situation, right? I'm a fan of quick, simple, healthy meals that get repeated often. I'll be sharing our most popular meals in my blog for you today. They are in no particular order. I'd also love to hear what your favourites are; feel free to leave a comment!

#### NACHOS

This is one of our "fun" meals that we have periodically, but it's always a hit and can have so many variations to it.

  
**Ingredients:**

* Nachos
* Shredded cheese
* Any variation of meat such as:

  Ham bits, bacon, chicken, hamburger
* Any variation of veggies such as:

  Peppers, onions, hot peppers, green onions, tomato

Serve the nachos on their own after broiling in the oven or with sour cream and/or salsa. If we're feeling like splurging a little, we buy Doritos and use those for the nachos. It's sooooo tasty!

#### PICKY PLATES

Picky plates or finger foods are what we do for most of our lunches. I put them in a round container with separated sections. I use my picky plate planner page from my Simple Meal Planning Guide to plan it out. I make sure to have a variety of foods from different food groups such as:  
nuts  
dairy  
protein  
fruits and vegetables

You can find out more about picky plates in my Meal Planning Guide as well as on this blog here:
