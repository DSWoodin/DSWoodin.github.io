#### Think outside of your box/bubble

People inevitably go into the experience of working on a long term design project with various preconceptions of what they want to make and why, especially if the project is one that involves considerable creativity with team members developing a sense of a personal or emotional stake in the functionality and success of the design. I am no exception – going into the early stages of planning a design project to promote user engagement at the Williams College Museum of Art, I had various disjoint yet specific visions for what my design could be. These ideas proved stubborn to disregard – I found myself leaning towards ideas that drew from my own experiences in museums and continually suggesting things to my group members that pushed our brainstorming in the direction of my own experience, without paying much attention to our need to broaden the scope of personas that might use our design. This is a slippery slope and an especially dangerous one to find yourself on in the early stages of the design process. 

My experience with creative projects usually involved coming up with an idea and then building it while making adjustments along the way – the notions of coming up with ideas iteratively and using feedback directly from my target user base to adjust my brainstorming were unfamiliar and felt almost unnatural to me. However, this process of actively seeking out information from people with different perspectives than myself and incorporating this wider reservoir of experience into my brainstorming process proved to be the most illuminating step of my design process. 

### Iterate, iterate, then iterate more!



### Work to make things accessible every step of the way



### Don't be afraid to steal: many of the most important ideas come from outside your own head



### Devote time to ethical considerations

#### Definition



#### Considering implications



#### Who am I building for?



#### Anticipate problems/possibility of causing harm
