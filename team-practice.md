subtitle: A 120-minute sample practice plan
---

This is a sample team practice plan designed for a 120-minute session. This is provided as an example of how you can structure
a practice to prepare for a competition. In this case, you would select a past Math Is Cool year (like 
[6th grade 2018-2019 Masters](http://www.academicsarecool.com/#/samples)) and use those questions.

| Start | End | Topic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0m | 10m | Start with college bowl questions to warm up.* This is a good activity to start with in case some members are late.
| 10m | 15m | Discussion of practice plan and Q&A.
| 15m | 35m | Discuss a topic for the week.* This might be covering a few questions for a specific topic or challenging questions from that MIC's individual test.
| 35m | 40m | Mental math and review.
| 40m | 65m | Team multiple choice and review.
| 65m | 90m | Team test and review.
| 90m | 100m | Relays and review.
| 100m | 120m | College bowl for remainder of time.

\* If you would like to run in 90 minutes instead, you can cut these.
