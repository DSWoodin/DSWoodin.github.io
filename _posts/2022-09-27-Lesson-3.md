In lesson 3 we learned about frameworks.

Frameworks are prewritten code that provides the end user with a standard to build their own custom application. Frameworks can be a great tool for both web development and for server-side code.

Web frameworks provide the bones of a site that allows you to quickly build out a website. Some popular frameworks include Bootstrap, Flask, Django, and Jekyll. Bootstrap and Jekyll were the two frameworks that we worked with in lesson 3.

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework used for the creation of websites and web apps. It was designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites and provides a collection of syntax for template designs.

Jekyll is also a free and open-source site generator. Text written in various languages are used with their layouts to create a static website.

Static websites are sites that have no dynamic content. There are probably HTML pages and other files that don't have any dynamic content such as a comment section or authentication.

Using Jekyll was foreign to me coming into this lesson. I had worked with Bootstrap briefly before, but not in-depth. I feel more confident in my abilities now and think it's incredible the way people create themes and site layouts for others to use. It makes it much easier to create a website.
