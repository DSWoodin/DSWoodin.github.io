In xDSL we are developing a Python toolbox for MLIR which will enable easy integration of MLIR with Python-based DSLs. Consequently, whilst DSL infrastructures have been traditionally highly siloed, using xDSL such developers can view their DSL as a front-end on-top of MLIR and LLVM, with xDSL facilitating this arrangement.
