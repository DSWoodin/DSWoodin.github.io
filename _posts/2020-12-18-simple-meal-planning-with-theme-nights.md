We actually have a great setup for breakfast foods and lunch foods with o_r_ [picky plates](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-make-lunches-painless-and-quick-with-picky-plates/), but suppers are the ones I struggle with for sure. Remembering to simple meal plan with theme nights makes it so much easier for me and predictable for everyone too!
