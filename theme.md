# Welcome to Fur Squared 2021, con-goers and fuzzies of myriad types abound\!

My name is 2.0 and I am the world's first sentient program that has been rigorously developed by ConGlomerate to help simulate a wonderful online convention experience for you all in February\! &nbsp;I have been tasked with developing various online interfaces that will grant you access to wonderful panelists, musicians, artists, game shows, video games, tabletop games and even vendors, all through a single series of interfaces\! &nbsp;This means you can enjoy most all of your favorite meatspace convention activities online, make new friends, go shopping, play games, rock out to awesome music, all from the safety of your own homes\! &nbsp;There will even be a simulated area within the Virtual Reality Chat world where you can show off all of your amazing avatars to everyone else\!

Due to my superior coding and design, there should be absolutely no bugs in the system whatsoever\! &nbsp;You will be free to make our convention-enjoying experience as fun-filled as you can\! &nbsp;Along with the virtual Dealer's Den we'll be hosting (utilizing amazing technology the likes of which none have seen before\!), there will be tons of artists streaming their work, available to be commissioned, as well as game masters of all levels of experience running all sorts of amazing game\!

Have you ever been to a virtual Dealer's Den? &nbsp;Have you seen sweet multi-artist art streams before? &nbsp;Have you ever played an RPG developed and run by a professional dungeon master? &nbsp;Have you ever attended a concert in your underwear before? Do you enjoy the enclosed and claustrophobic monotony of quarantine life?

If you answered "No" to any of these questions, then Fur Squared 2021 has got JUST the solution for you\! &nbsp;Make sure to come on down and log on in at [https://con.glomerate.co](https://con.glomerate.co), February 26th-28th to get your Furry fixins of all types\!

# Play along\!

&nbsp;{{Error:&nbsp; UNDEFINED }} ... Something seems to be amiss during the weekend's activities as this virtual convention seems to be a bit more than meets the eye.&nbsp; With glitches, interruptions and more abound, it's growing clear that whatever's happening is far more than just a bug in the software. It's up to YOU to figure out exactly what's going on behind the scenes\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the course of the weekend, various hints and clues will be showing up in all sorts of places.&nbsp; Once you make an account at [https://con.glomerate.co](https://con.glomerate.co), you can begin collecting these codes that may be given out in a myriad of ways, so pay close attention to all of your conventional surroundings\!&nbsp; The more secret information you collect, the deeper into the story you will descend\!&nbsp; There are various forces at play over the weekend, and not all of them are on your side\!&nbsp; Although you *can* share the secret information you've discovered with others, keep in mind that others (including your fellow con-goers) might be working to achieve an opposing goal\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; This endeavor also coincides with activities on VR Chat, and although you don't NEED VR Chat to be able to participate, the content released on VR Chat can greatly enhance your experience with additional content\!

&nbsp; &nbsp; Your work begins now\!&nbsp; Keep your wits about you, and help save the convention (one way or another\!)
