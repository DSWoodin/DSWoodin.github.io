 Ok. Being a long term credit card user here are my observations :


1. Amex has the best customer service + all domestic lounge access including the only Amex lounge at Bombay airport. However the reward percentage is very poor on my card- platinum reserve. Get 2 book my show vouchers on 25 k spend. Golf is free- I don’t play. concierge service is free but don’t really see the use as they too use google for checking on any info. No international lounge access. 10k yearly fee. 

2. HDFC regalia card is superb. Accepted everywhere. Domestic lounge access. More important free international lounge access. Limited to I think 3 or 6 per year. I have to recheck. Late payment is waived off automatically - I don’t know how. I paid late by a day this month. They charged and then reversed. Lifesaver. Other cards need to be cajoled. 

3. SBI Elite is a brilliant card. Super rewards. 2 book my show vouchers every month. 5k annual fees. Definitely worth it. They too give free domestic and international lounge access. Free. Limited visits. 

4. Earlier lounge access was the attraction.  But now I would shun lounge visits at domestic airport. Horrible. Horror. Bakwaas lounges. More packed than an unreserved railway compartment. Bad food. No seating. Avoid it now. Even debit cards have lounge access nowadays. 

5. International lounge access is to be treasured. Especially in quality airports like Singapore and HK. 

Any card with these features is to be taken :

1. Preferably free

2. Good rewards points value - minimum 0.40

3. International lounge access free. 

4. Free book my show vouchers.
