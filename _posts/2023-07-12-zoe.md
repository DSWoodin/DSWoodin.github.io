I've been pet sitting for years, mostly for half-a-dozen long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.


and it's still (mostly) a pleasure. Half a dozen "regulars" use my have years of experience sitting animals.


I also do House Sitting for Â£30 per day or part of day. For this Bill and I will:
 - sleep overnight in your house, bringing our own bedding
 - provide our own food
 - ensure that one of us is in most of the day
 - maintain security and attend to any issues that arise
 - leave your house in the same state we found it
 - water your plants (but not do other gardening)

I have half-a-dozen "regulars" who use this service. Some have been with me for years.

Because I can only sit one house at a time and am sometimes continuously booked, please contact me well in advance.
