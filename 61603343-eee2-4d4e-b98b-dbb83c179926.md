 Okay first things first:

You need garam masala for multiple parts of this recipe. I have plenty of store bought ones that do the job but a homemade garam masala is a game changer, it turns even the duddest of curry's to an 11. If you can, please PLEASE make your own, you will tell the difference. However, if making your own is what's stopping you from trying this recipe, then store bought is fine.

What you need:

- 1 Tbsp coriander seeds

- 1 Tbsp cumin seeds

- 1 tsp green cardamom pods

- 1 tsp cloves

- 1 tsp Black peppercorns

- 2 sticks cinnamon

- 2 x bayleaves

- 1/2 small nutmeg

- 4 Black cardomom pods

Lightly toast in a dry frying pan until aromatic

Blitz in a grinder until smooth, not gritty

Done! You'll know youve made a garam masala that slaps if your whole kitchen is aromatic with spices

-------

Next stage is a curry base:

Most curry's are done with a curry or onion base to start with then adding more ingredients to make it a certain kind of curry

So you need:

- 4tbsp olive oil

-1kg onions

-1tsp salt

-50g ginger

-50g garlic

-1.5 litres water

- 1x can tomatoes

- 1tsp tomato puree

- 1tsp turmeric

- 1 tsp paprika

Method:

Add 1 Tbsp oil to a large pan and heat the oil up to a high heat. 

Add all the onion stirring for a min or 2, turn the heat down a lil and cook for 10 mins ensuring it doesn't burn, stirring frequently. Add salt and turn the heat all the way down and cover pan with lid, cook for a further 20 mins stirring it every 5 mins or when needed. 

Add ginger and garlic, turn up the heat a lil and cook for 1 or 2 mins until aromatic. 

Add the water, bring to a boil then to a simmer and leave to cook with lid partly covering it for 20-25 mins

Then leave to cool

Blend the sauce until smooth, reserve 4tbsp of this sauce. Get a new saucepan and lid

The rest of this sauce can be frozen at this stage for up to 2 months

Blend a tin of tomatoes until smooth. 

Heat the remaining 3 Tbsp of oil in new pan on a high heat. Add tomato puree, turmeric and paprika and cook for 30 second. Add blended tomatoes and bring to boil, turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for 10 mins stirring occasionally 

Add the remaining sauce and bring to a boil again, then turn down to a simmer and cook for another 20-25 mins. Froth will rise to the top and must be skimmed. 

Once done this sauce can be frozen for a month, refrigerated for 4 days or can be used immediately.

Marinade:

This is the marinade for the chicken, I highly recommend you do this the night before using it however you can do it in the morning, it needs to be marinated for at least 12 hours

What you need:

275ml plain Yoghurt 

2 green chillies chopped up

2 tsp grated ginger

3 cloves of chopped garlic

1 1/2 teaspoon salt 

1tsp red chilli powder

1tsp Black cumin (normal cumin will suffice) 

1 1/2 tsp garam masala 

2 tsp vinegar 

2 Tbsp olive oil

2 tsp paprika

2 tsp turmeric 

Combine yogurt, chillies, garlic, ginger and blend until smooth 

Add and combine all the ingredients together 

Add slices uncooked chicken to it (I think it yeilds 5 breast fillets) 

Leave in fridge until use


-----

Preparing the chicken for final cook

So just before the final curry, the marinated chicken needs to be cooked before added to the final stage. 

You CAN also not marinade the chicken and just do this stage, however I recommend you marinade if you like chicken tikka pieces in your curry. 

You also just have the marinated chicken as a meal on its own. 

So, to prepare the chicken 

5 chicken fillets (marinated or not) 

6 Tbsp olive oil

1 tsp turmeric 

4 Tbsp reserved curry base sauce from earlier 

Steps: 

Add oil, sauce and turmeric in a pan and cook on medium heat until sauce darkens (4-5mins)

Add chicken, stir until each piece is well coated in sauce and cook on a low heat, pan covered with for 15-20 mins or until chicken pieces are cooked through 

Use ASAP 

------

The final sauce: 

So, you have your base, you have your cooked chicken pieces. Now let's get them mingling! 

What you need:

4tbsp olive oil

1/2 tsp cumin 

425ml curry base sauce

1 tsp paprika

1 tsp salt 

1 lvl tsp chilli powder

1tsp garam masala 

Prepared chicken 

6 Tbsp single cream

1 Tbsp freshly chopped coriander 

Method:

- heat oil in large frying pan or wok, add cumin

- stir for a few seconds then add curry base, bring to boil

- add paprika, salt, chilli powder: cook on high until sauce thickens which take about 4-5mins 


- turn down heat and add garam masala, cook on low, stirring for 3 mins 

- cut each piece of chicken into 2, add the sauce, add single cream. Cook for a further 3 mins 

- add coriander, stir some through as well as some for garnish
