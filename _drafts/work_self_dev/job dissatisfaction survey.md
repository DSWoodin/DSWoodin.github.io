# job dissatisfaction survey

I am a software engineer at a startup. I worked my ass off for around a year and then I started wondering what I was doing. I had so many aspirations and now they're all gone. 

I woke up when it was dark outside and got back home when it was dark. The people I lived with never even saw me. It took Friday evening and half of Saturday to feel like myself again and just a half day before I started dreading it all over again. 

I thought it was the job, the open office, the commute. Well during Covid two of those (thankfully the layout and the commute) disappeared overnight.

I relatively enjoy my job. It's not a passion or anything but I do it. Sometimes it's boring sometimes it's exciting. The people aren't bad.

I just want time in my life back. It's like my brain has this background buzz that is my job. I wish it wasn't so normalised, I wish everything wasn't so competitive that I have to spend my nights and weekends cramming facts into my brain. 

People say they work 9-5. That would be a dream. There's a book called the Four hour workweek. Does that even work for people who aren't in a first world country and who don't have oodles of money and who actually want to make a real difference?

I cannot remember the last time I woke up in the morning on weekdays with anything but a sense of dread. I stay up late on Sunday nights because I just want the weekend to be longer. The more holidays I take the more I want to take. 

I'm just a year and a half out of college. How am I going to do this for the rest of my life? 

I don't want to run away to a different country. I want us to be better. I want to be better.

Even if you don't fill this out, I hope this post shows everyone out there feeling this way that there are others like you.
