## Good Design

  For my example of good design, I have chosen the Williams alumni page from the Williams College website, which can be found at this link: https://alumni.williams.edu.

![Good Design (Alumni Website)](https://github.com/samzgrunebaum/samzgrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-10%20at%205.01.37%20PM.png)

  I chose this page because it is simple and attractive â€“ moreover, it clearly conveys relevant information to the average user. This page, after all, is meant to be used by Williams alumni to access information that is relevant to alumni regarding Williams and their relationship to the college post-graduation. The central area to the left of the page features three large articles in a similar format to a news website. The menu to the right lists different links to pages that alumni might want to access. Some of these links also have the option to expand the menu with a plus sign. As is expected by the user, a sub-menu drops down when the plus sign is clicked that has more specific options (e.g. "Alumni Directory Login" has the options "Directory Search" and "Profile Update" as links).
  
![Expanded "Alumni Directory Login"](https://github.com/samzgrunebaum/samzgrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-10%20at%205.01.37%20PM.png)  
  
  This makes sense because, while this page is used by Williams alumni, it is also used by Williams to promote various causes for alumni that benefit the school. Featuring these articles engages alumni who may find the articles either personally relevant or simply interesting while also showcasing some of the beneficial things that alumni can do (e.g. be a mentor, volunteer and give back) or things that the school offers for alumni (e.g. off campus events, medals recognizing distinguished alumni).
