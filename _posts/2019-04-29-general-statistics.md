title: General statistics

Statistics in ecology can be a tricky endevour with real data. My PhD work focuses on Bayesian Hierarical Modelling with Ecological Data. These are the resources I have used and still do at times. To begin to understand and teach Bayesian methods I often refer to older and often more understood statistical methods. 

Some general statistics resources:

## [Data Carpentry]("https://datacarpentry.org/")

This is an open source community that teaches R and other data tools. They also run workshops and classes at many Australian Universities. IN there words

"Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full life cycle of data-driven research."

## Data Science community

These resources are very helpful but take a slightly different approach to ecological studies however the pay is much better as a "data scientist (DS)" https://www.rfordatasci.com/in the current job marketThe DS community is great and even have there own slack channel. I still haven't found a great resource for this but here are a few general videos to start here; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQ61RZKzwE" >a basic overview</a> but has a boring intro or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNV9EqwXCpw" > microsoft</a> video here but its pretty dry.</p>

## Hierarical modelling

## Courses and Tutorials

## Invasive species research

## Bayesian modelling
My PhD work is focused around invasive species in NZ forests.
