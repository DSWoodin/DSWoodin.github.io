My struggle with mental health made me realize that there was more to life than personal achievement. Quality of life, including relationships with family and friends, partaking in activities that I enjoy, keeping active, and exploring the world around me are equally important, if not more. Gratitude has completely changed my outlook on life. I am a much happier, healthier, and well rounded person because of it.
