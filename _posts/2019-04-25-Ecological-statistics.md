Statistics in ecology can be a tricky endevour with real data. My PhD research focuses on Bayesian Hierarical Modelling with Ecological Data. These are the resources I have used and still do at times. To begin to understand and teach Bayesian methods I often refer to older and often more understood statistical methods.

## General ecological statistics

These are the resources I often talk about and personally use regularly. I have only added my brief notes and am no way affiliated or represent any of the resources below. 

I haven't meet many of these researchers and developers but hopefully one day. Most of the resources are open-source and are forked to my personal [github account](https://github.com/davan690/).


[Colby Ecology Course](https://colbyecology.github.io/): A mathematical ecology course that I have not done but I think it looks pretty kol. Let me know if anyone does it.

https://github.com/davan690/The Statistics Network  My personal list of resources but in particular look at the `usefulr` repository. I am updating this as and when I find new resources. Mostly, this list is to support my own development and to remind myself how to do many of these R and Markdown tricks and tips I find on the web. 

<a href="http://stat545.com/Classroom/" >STAT545This is an amazing graduate course from the University of British Columbia. I will often return to this course to check code and explanations I need.

<a href="https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/r-more/topics/tidyverse.html" > Monash helpThis is a simple html page similar to this with information for Monash bio-informatics platform.

https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" Cheat-sheets These are really important and RStudio do many good ones. There are many other variations out there though.

<h2> Bio-informatics </h2>

A very limited list of genetics options. I am no way an expert with these packages or analyses.
