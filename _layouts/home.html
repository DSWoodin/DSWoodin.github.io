  <p>This webpage is a simple collection of detailed resources and information I use for my phd work, as part of the statistics network and other research projects.  I hope with time these resources will develop into a learning resource for researchers and small business owners, regardless of statistical knowledge.So far on the website. The resources here are open-source and can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/davan690/" class="btn btn-primary">here</a>.</p>
  <p>I post some of the interesting social media posts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/" class="btn btn-primary">here</a></p>
