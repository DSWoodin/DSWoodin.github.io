In marine research such as the study of the ecology and the distribution of benthic foraminifera, bathymetric maps are indispensable [1–3] to the understanding of the seafloor topography.  The map provides insights into the depth ranges and gradients of environmental condition under which organisms can be found. Bathymetric maps are also useful in costal restorations projects, coral reef management, risk assessment, marine pollution and other research in marine geology, ecology, and oceanography.   For example, different species of  benthic foraminifera are known to be limited by their tolerance to salinity, oxygen,  availability of food, substrate type etc. which are in turn functions of depth [4–6].
