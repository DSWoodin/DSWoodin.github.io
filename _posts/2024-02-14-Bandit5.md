# Bandit5 - 6


### Password: P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU



## Problem


**Bandit Level 5 - Level 6**


**Level Goal**


The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable



## Solving


1. **Check ou which files and folders are located in the home directory**
    
    - At first, I checked out files and folders in the home directory. There was `inhere` folder 

    `ls`

    - I went to the `inhere` folder.

    `cd inhere`

2. **Check the files if it is human-readable**
    
    - Since the question mentioned that the password is stored somewhere under the inhere directory. In the `inhere` folder, I tried to find a file which is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable.

    `find . -size 1033c ! -executable` 

    - **find**: The command that initiates the search.

    - **.**: Specifies the starting point for the search. In this case, `.` refers to the current directory, i.e., the directory from which the command is being run.

    - **-size 1033c**: This option is used to specify that the search should only return files of a specific size. The notation `1033c` means exactly 1033 bytes, where `c` stands for bytes, indicating the size of the files to find.
    
    - **! -executable**: This part of the command is used to filter the search results further. The `!` operator means "not". The `-executable` option specifies files that are executable. Therefore, `! -executable` means to exclude files that are executable, i.e., the command will search for files that are not executable.

    - There was only one file that satisfied the conditions. I tried to read the file using `cat`

    `cat ./maybehere07/.file2`
