title: 2018-2019 Coordinated readings
subtitle: To help educate evolutionary biologists about the kinds of questions that marine scientists care about and to help educate marine scientists about the kinds of questions that evolutionary biologists care about, we have developed a recommended reading list of classic papers in both fields.
---

Our coordinated reading groups will meet every two weeks to discuss two papers covering each of a series of topics in marine and evolutionary biology.  Groups participating in these discussions can meet at their home institutions once during each two-week period (any time during the two weeks is fine), either as part of a lab meeting or another seminar or journal club.  Participants will discuss the papers listed for that week, and address the discussion questions provided with each topic.  For each topic, the group should then choose one person to summarize the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions on a Slack channel we have set up to facilitate discussions at evolvingseas.slack.com. Discussion groups can also use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups.

## Theme and rationale
For our first set of coordinated readings, we decided to focus the scale of spatial and temporal variability in the ocean, with a focus on how this variability may influence evolutionary processes. We are interested to have discussions about how adaptive change in populations may be structured in space in time, particularly below the scale of gene flow. Some of the readings were also designed to spark discussions about what constitutes evidence for adaptation and how we should design studies to study adaptation. Keep in mind there are many themes that we hope to discuss in the future (e.g., plasticity, evolutionary rescue, eco-evo dynamics and evolution in a community context) if this first coordinated readings is successful.

We encourage all participants who would like to attend one of our workshops in the next three years (Synthesis, Genomics, or Training/Integration) to pariticipate in the discussions on the Slack channel.

## Week 1: Deadline for discussion January 21

### Topic - Spatial and temporal scale of environmental variation

**Rationale:**

The ocean is structured in space and time, which is comprised of benthic structure and pelagic structure. While benthic structure is similar to strcuture in terrestrial systems, there are only weak terrestrial parallels to pelagic structure which is critical to both habitat pattern and dispersal in the ocean. This week we want the RCN to think about how the scales of environmental variabiilty is reflected in evolution of marine populations.

[Comparison of marine and terrestrial ecosystems: suggestions of an evolutionary perspective influenced by environmental variation](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsy149/5161207)

John H Steele, Kenneth H Brink & Beth E Scott

**Paper 2:** 

[Microgeographic adaptation and the spatial scale of evolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714000159)

Jonathan L. Richardson, Mark C. Urban, Daniel I. Bolnick & David K. Skelly

**Optional Background Paper:**

[Why Life Histories Evolve Differently in the Sea](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/30/1/197/133967)

Richard R. Strathmann

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Are marine systems less or more variable environments than terrestrial systems and how does this vary across scales? 

2. How can we link the scale of environmental variability to microgeographic adaptation in the ocean? Could other mechanisms be at play?

## Week 2

### Topic - Local adaptation (Conceptual)

**Rationale:**

This week we want the RCN to think about different ways we define local adaptation and come to a concensus as a network on a definition of local adaptation that we should use.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

[Conceptual issues in local adaptation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00684.x)

Tadeusz J. Kawecki & Dieter Ebert

**Paper 2:** 

[A practical guide to measuring local adaptation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12150)

François Blanquart, Oliver Kaltz, Scott L. Nuismer & Sylvain Gandon

**Optional Background Paper:**

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What are the implications for how we individually define local adaptation on how we study it and what we think about the processes that drive it?

2. What definition of local adaption should we (the RCN-ECS network) should use?
