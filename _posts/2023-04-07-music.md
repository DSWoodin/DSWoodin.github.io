__Picture this:__ is friday morning, you are completely distracted while on a Complex Analysis class, and suddenly you think "Which is my favorite album to listen to?", obviously the first answer that came to my mind was ___"Memories do not open, duuh"___.<br>

But, is it? Do i like that much "Memories do not open"? Or is it just the fact that i listened to it a lot during 2017 because I was heartbroken?<br>
So initially I checked every Chainsmokers album, and realized that the album I most enjoyed was definitely __"Sick Boy"__, because of the timing of the album and the topic of itself.<br>
BUT, the one I could hear nonstop for the rest of my life is __"World War Joy"__.<br>
So, which of these 3 is my favorite Chainsmokers album? The one that helped me the most, the one I most enjoyed or the one I still most enjoy?<br>

That question will be answered today, at the end of this post!

Ok, I know that introduction was a total audience killer.<br>
___"Ugh, a post about a pair of Djs i dont even know? pass..."___<br>
No, this post is about ___the music I love___, and why I love it, so yes... now you can leave, cause absolutely no one cares about this. But still.<br> 
I find it funny, and creative idea to analyze, or for people to analyze me.

So, this is a simple post, no structure actually...<br>
I'll just list my favorite albums, songs and artists and explain why. And that's it.<br>
And if you also love any of those, feel free to become my best friend <3<br>

## Artists

### Airbag

I listen to Airbag since I was a little boy, playing with chalk while listening to Radio Disney.<br>
But it was not until 2022 when I returned to their music, and daaamn ***I MISSED THEM***.<br>
Is it rock? Pop? Soft rock? I don't care, it is magical...<br>
Their songs go from "___I've lost, we've lost___" to "___I am living a fucking dream you will never reach___".<br>
Songs that take you down with phrases like "___Sometimes I fool myself, by reading old books that say the good ones win___", but they also have songs so crazy like "___I'll just party, I'm freaking crazy___".<br>
Most of their music brings you down, but they give you some hope, and it's just so artistic... <br>
I can't choose my favorite song, but this one is pure Airbag: [Por mil noches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfkr1WEzIc)

### Bastille

Bastille and the next group are just pure comfort for me.<br>
I met them when they released ___"Pompeii"___, and I declared myself a fan when listened to ___"Glory"___
These guys simply are magical, they create such melodies, I don't really know if I can say they have a style...<br>
Their lyrics can talk about so many things, and their covers! ___OMG THEIR COVERS.___
Listening to their music is simply a break from the world, a moment to dissapear ans sing, to feel... __Feel their music.__

I love you Dan Smith.<br>

### Of Monsters and Men
<img src="/assets/img/music_post/OMAM.jpg" width="250" height="180" class="center"><br>

I remember I only liked [one of their songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghb6eDopW8I), and I didn't find anything interesting on their music in general.<br>
Until one day, when I was sad and depressed as hell, I decided to listen to ["Yellow light"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBlKPLeLU_s).
I cried my heart out while listening to such magical melody. And once the song was over, it was all gone.<br>
I listened a couple more songs and fell in love, all of their songs are an ___emotional journey___.<br>
Each song is so strong and ___makes you feel like you're alive!___ <br>
Each song takes you by the hand and whispers to you ___"It's all ok".___<br>

When everything is lost, I just stop and listen to Of Monsters and Men...

### Kygo

Ok, I don't consider myself a great Kygo fan, I like his music and I listen to all of his songs.<br>
I've never felt like he is an artist I love, but apparently...<br>
___Kygo is the artist I listen to the most since 2019___, according to Youtube and Spotify stats.<br>
When I found out about this I was surprised, and checking the facts...<br>
___There is not a Kygo's song I dislike___, I have all of his songs in my playlists, absolutely all of them, no exageration.

So, I can't say there is a reason, but it seems like [I love Kygo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vusqQJ56iIM).

### The Chainsmokers
I love The Chainsmokers so much, that they are on the 3 sections of this post.<br>
The Chainsmokers '*saved my life*', twice actually.<br>
I was never suicidal, but I was very depressed and in a dark place in my life during 2017 and parts of 2018-2019.<br>
In 2017 their music was a good company too keep my head busy, but in 2018 ___it was just perfect___.<br>
Each of their songs for the album ___"Sick Boy"___ fitted just perfect with the events happening in my life <br>
At all time, their music from sad, to just rave senseless remix, I just love so much what they do.
