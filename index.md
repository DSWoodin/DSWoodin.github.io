Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher and consultant, working toward evidence-based climate policy design. My areas of focus include energy systems, carbon pricing, and techno-economic modeling.

### Research
I am a Senior Research Associate at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. My research leverages diverse methods matched to the problem at hand, with a focus on quantitative models. 

I have served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing and testified in front of legislators on renewable energy policy. I have provided analyses on carbon pricing policy to governments, Members of the European Parliament, and Fortune Global 500 companies. My research has been featured in policy hearings in the EU Parliament and Commission and quoted in the media including the BBC, Wall Street Journal, Politico, the Guardian, and Reuters.

### Forecasting
I provide forecasts on geopolitics and economics as a superforecaster at Good Judgment. Previously, I participated in IARPA's second Geopolitical Forecasting Challenge, where our team placed in the top five. I have made hundreds of probabilitisc forecasts on Good Judgment Open and [placed](https://www.gjopen.com/memberships/57797/scores) in the top 0.1 percent of forecasters.
