 Make your health your top priority. You can run away from a lot of things in life, but you can't run away from yourself.

* Get a proper night's sleep for what your body needs. Go to bed at about the same time each night and try not to stray from it.

* Eat foods that are colourful and varied in texture. Learn to cook from scratch.

* Work in some form of exercise into your life, whether it's a club or class or something you do on your own. You'll get to a point one day when you'll rely on your body, and you'll need it in a shape you can count on.

Oh, and never stop reading or learning or asking questions or talking to people. The more you learn, the better off you'll be. Learning never stops (or rather, learning *should* never stop).

Edit: go to bed at the same time each night, not morning.
