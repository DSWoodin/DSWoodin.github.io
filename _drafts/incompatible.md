 Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. It really resonates with me and I can relate in so many ways. 

My boyfriend and I were that iconic couple too. Best friends, communicated well, lots of similar interests while also being our own people, truly was “the one” in so many ways. There are definitely some differences between my relationship and yours. I was the one that ended it. Ultimately while we were extremely compatible for the most part for our 2-ish year relationship we had some very fundamental and philosophical differences regarding how we wanted to live life and raise a family that I knew would lead to unhappiness (and did). We each wanted the other to be what we were not. I couldn’t lie about who I was. He did for a while, which hurt me terribly. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in this life was choose to end it. I had to love myself, and by proxy, love him enough to realize he wouldn’t be happy either. Afterwards, some true colors of his showed, which confirmed my decision, but it doesn’t mean I don’t terribly miss him and what we had. He has asked to get back together, and it killed me to say no, because I know if I did I would be overlooking everything that doesn’t work about us and choosing only to see the things that did. 

I am so glad you have found peace. I am sure she will one day realize how much of a mistake she made wanting that Disney love. I know I don’t regret my decision, but I can’t say I don’t miss him with every part of me. I miss that “non Disney” love. That steady love. I know it will take me a very long time to find and build that again. I’m sure she will recognize that too. And if she doesn’t that is completely her loss.
