# Dealer's Den & Artist Alley

We are super excited about some of the ideas we have planned for our virtual dealer's den and artist alley this year\!

We are looking into specifics such as an online marketplace, a "physical" 3D VR dealer's den, as well as advertising opportunities that will play throughout the virtual stream.

Dealers and Artists are the backbone of any great convention and we want to make sure we maintain the high level of care we always place into this particular part of the con. A virtual convention is an entirely new endeavor for us and for the organization as a whole. So we ask for your patience during this time as we figure out the best course of action forward.

Expect more information soon as we work behind the scenes to put together this incredible virtual event\!
