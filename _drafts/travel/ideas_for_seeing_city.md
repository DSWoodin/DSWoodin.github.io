 It takes some research, but most cities have things like smaller theater venues, lecture series on cool stuff, maker shops, planetariums, art theaters, specialty museums and galleries, old restored parts of town with interesting stores and smaller eateries, and so on. These things are often really cool and interesting, and in unique places.

Do a gourmet picnic (millions of ideas online) someplace interesting, like at the zoo or nature center, an interesting state park, a hilltop at night during a meteor shower, etc.

Go old school retro- diners, roller skating/bowling, drive in movies (or movies in the park sort of thing).

Taster's tour. Go to several nicer restaurants in an area and just get an appetizer, small plate meal, drink, or whatever at each, then walk to the next.

Local college? Often you can go to their games, movie nights, guest speakers, recitals, etc. for free or cheap.

Farmer's markets or the like. Wander and buy little things all over- breakfast rolls here, a smoothie there, a fresh flower at another stall, etc.
