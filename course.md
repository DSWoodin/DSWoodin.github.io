## Course Description

_The Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms_ is a six week online course (or go at your own pace) designed to help busy moms explore how to simplify home life in many key areas such as daily routines, decluttering, and habits. Participants gain access to course units (both text and some video) as well as a course guide full of guided printables, journal prompts, resources, and more.

**Please note:** This is NOT a one size fits all course. It’s also not a one-time solution course as I believe that life is a LIFELONG process of learning and growing. I will promise you, however, that this course is packed with things you can learn and grow with today and going forward. 

I'm not an expert, but I have life experience as a mom of four, and journeying along the road to simplifying. I’m just like you, wading through finding myself over the years at home. Welcome to the S_implify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms_. I’m so happy to have you here to check this course out to see if it would be helpful for you!

## Reviews

> Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms was an amazing experience! I loved the units; each was something that I needed to dig into more as I work to simplify my life and home. The layout for this course was perfect, giving time and space to work on each subject before moving on. I love that I can go back and work through the ones that are more challenging for my household. Kelly’s support and encouragement to tackle things one small bit at a time was just what I needed! I will definitely recommend this course to my friends who are looking to make changes in their lives to simplify. - Deanna

> I have to say I love how simply laid out your course is! I love the units lay out and overall how great this has been . The printable sheets are so helpful I have my own little booklet of all of them now. - Terri

My favorite module was the time management lesson! But every module gives practical and easy to follow tools to better your home life! Such a great course! - Shelly

> Kelly’s course is truly amazing and life changing. She teaches you how to simplify your busy mom life and I love that I can work at my own pace. It’s not rushed at all. You get to be part of a community of other moms on the same journey as you are and working on the same steps! If anyone could guide you to living slow Kelly is definitely it! She’s also the mama that has helped me so much in simplifying our homeschool too and I can’t thank her enough! - Jessica

## About me

I’m a mother of four children - three boys, one toddler girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. I’m a past elementary teacher, turned stay at home, work at home mom eight  years ago after I had my second child. I’ve found that the busier I’ve become and as my children age, that it’s become even more important to figure out what is most important to me and us as a family. Living a simpler lifestyle has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, stronger connections with my people. It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of my home and life. I enjoy helping busy moms simplify home life by learning flexible planning methods and skills. Listen more about my take on simplifying things at home on a podcast I was interviewed on [here](https://www.stitcher.com/show/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/episode/keeping-it-simple-an-interview-with-kelly-79787253).
