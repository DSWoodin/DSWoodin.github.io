lifestyle design as a replacement for multi-staged career planning

Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.

job descriptions as self-descriptions.

Most people, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.

$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows.

The commonsense rules of the “real world” are a fragile collection of socially reinforced illusions.

the perfect job is the one that takes the least time.

Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or broken, and it doesn’t require being unethical.

techniques for cultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and otherwise ignoring the unimportant.

Liberation is not about cheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location.

NR:To have others work for you.

To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum effective load”).

NR:To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.

NR:To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.

NR:To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time.

NR:To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps included.

NR:To have more quality and less clutter.

NR:To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.

NR:To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W).

If you can free your time and location, your money is automatically worth 3–10 times as much.

Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it.

formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.

Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested.

The same is true in life and in lifestyles.

1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.

Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive.

Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness.

For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks.

“Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.

Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.

Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.

“If only I had more money” is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment

Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.

Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours.

eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.

People who avoid all criticism fail.

Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.

Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.

I realized that on a scale of 1–10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my so-called worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4.

There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,” and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine anyway.” Either way, nothing happens.

Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.

the reward of those who have no fear of discomfort.
