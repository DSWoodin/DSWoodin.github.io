subtitle: Introduction to Bayesian Optimization

The optimization of machine learning algorithms is one of the most important research areas since the parameters of each supervised learning algorithm needs to be trained. 
However, the same tools can be used to optimize physical-chemistry problems. Here, we introduce one of the most novel ML algorithms to optimize black-box functions known as **Bayesian Optimization**. 
Using BO and GPs, we present an innovative algorithm that allows us to fit PESs with accurate quantum dynamics observables or tune the parameters of Density functional models.
