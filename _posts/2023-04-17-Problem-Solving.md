Back again everyone, After launching the first blog post with all the enthusiam I got derailed for a week. My mind essentially was not progressing thing in right order as there are numerous things kept on bugging me on a daily basis. Although, Most of the still not resolved but in progress to manifesting the apprach of solution or to say defining the problems in the first place. This is what I wanna talk about in this blogspot.

I don't think there is any part of the life which doesn't have problems/issues/caveats. These are bare building blocks of our lifes. Like any other journey which we usually do by car or by train we pass many stations/cities similary problems are those cities in our life's journey. Those are just steps and every step is closer to our destination. Unlike a straight forward drive, problems in our professional or personal life requires substantial patience and intelligence to solve.

## First part of solving a problem
I believe most problems in the have a solution. Infact considering the world's population its quite possible that your problem already has a solution to it. These are not limited to technical problems or factual problems. Even if we have a unique problem, the solution could potentially be drived from already solved relatable problems. What we require is **PATIENCE**.

IMO and how I enhanced my patience is by extentive reading (doesn't require anything in particular), handling problems in first hand. Reading helped me to find right words to understand the problem and also gain some time to aborse the severity of the problem. This later part is very important, as it gives you time to stucture a problem and moving on to solve it. 

## Structing a problem

Before even arriving to a solution, One one structure the problem itself. One should come up with questions as:
1. What is bare minimum is problem is asking.
2. How could I defrgament the problems into smaller chuncks. 
3. Setting up priorities of these smmaller chuncks even before picking it up to solve. Maybe in professing solve it is analogous to creating user-stories in JIRA. 
4. Assigning these chuncks, who or how it could be solved. In adverse sitution, If possible delegation some of those chuncks is not a bad option. Internet also comes really handy here as you can also delegate sometimes some chuncks to be solved via internet (working smart isn't a bad option.)
5. Finally, Be clam. As manager and my accidents taught me being calm while finding solution can give you clarity. This is something could be practised as well. Keeping a trust in yourself. Keep backing yourself will definitely enhances the calm.

## Working a solution

Working on a solution could be fun as well. Once you have  

Signing off.
