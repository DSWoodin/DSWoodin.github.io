## What is the data modeling? 

It can be abstraction of reality and is the process of analyzing and defining all the different data types 

# Conceptual Data Model(CDM)

 - It is main entities of the domain/business

 - So it should be technical and non-technical because I need to communicate with various stakeholders

 - It provides a big-picture view of an organiztion's data requirements without diving into technical details of how the data will be store or manipulated

 - It is independent from the technology we are going to choose

 - It is a smooth transition to a detailed logical and physical data model

 - It can be changed


Homework: draw the conceptual model of my project, send it to Fatma


Physical Data Model(PDM)

 - Unlike the conceptual model, it does not need to reflect the whole domain. It can be built incrementally

 - It is much about communication with technical people, not business people 

Relational database

 - Structure: In a relational database, all data is structured in a tabular format, consisting of rows and columns.
 - Data Representation: Each table represents a collection of related data, and each row in a table represents a single, implicitly structured data item.
 - Key-Value Pairs: The database is designed to recognize data based on the key-value pairs, ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient data retrieval.
