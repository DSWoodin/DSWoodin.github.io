I had the pleasure of being at a startup with a very talented SRE named M. Harrison. His minimum-level review criteria were that when you were planning to approve a PR, you should summarize everything the PR does in the approval comment. Responses like ":thumbsup:" or "LGTM" were not allowed. When I would read a PR intending to understand and then summarize, the errors or omissions (eventually) started to just jump out at me. I'm not sure if I'm articulating it properly...but that expectation of a small book report-ish paragraph helped me become much better at critically reviewing PRs.

disclaimer: the majority(not all) PR's were in a very very large terraform codebase.
