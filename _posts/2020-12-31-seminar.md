## Abstract

Jets/winds are ubiquitously in association with different celestial objects. However, most of previous theoretical studies of them rely on numerical calculations, not being able to provide a more convenient way for understanding rather abundant observational results. Now we have obtained a general analytical solution for describing a magnetically dominated jet/wind. This solution is consistent with known theoretical results and numerical simulations, and can be used to interpret main observational results, such as jet shape configuration, acceleration profile (from non-relativistic to relativistic), and polarization pattern etc. Furthermore, the solution is applicable to, e.g., limb-brightening (a hollow jet), periodical signals (a helical jet), and "complex" proper motion pattern (a stratified jet) etc. I this talk, I will present the details of the theory, examples of comparing with observations, and a variety of predictions (ref.: [arXiv](arxiv.org/abs/2010.14470), ApJ, accepted).
