 OP, whenever men try to do this to me anywhere on Reddit, I come at them hard. And I use their own "logic" against them in arguments. I have always been naturally good at winning arguments. 

They obviously do this, because they are small, and they know it. So I make them know that I know they are small. I insult their ignorance, lack of intelligence, closed-off world view. And I am firm and rude and dismissive.

A lot of these men are not going to get it until women start completely anhilating them with our words. Because when they realise this is the reaction they are going to get, they will think twice before projecting their weakness on others. 

Those men are all bark and no bite. Deny their request to chat. Or accept it, insult them then immediately block.

The ones who sent dick pics, tell them no wonder no woman will agree to see it in real life (which is true). Tell them you will post it on a "misshapenpenis" sub then block.

The ones that send death threats - that is actually a crime. Report it to the FBI. Also report it to Reddit. Screenshot all of these. Let them know you are reporting it the FBI. Then block! 

Men like this have never had women stand up to them. So when you do, all they feel is fear, hence the overmasculine, misogynistic bravado which with they react.

Don't back down. These men are like the racists who used to wait for Freedom Fighters at their destination to beat them up. When you stand up to insecure losers, you put them in their place!
