 My mom is a "that's just how things are" person and one of the best days of my life was when I said to her "that's how things are because people like YOU say that's just how things are. *I* am going to try to change it and even if I can't, I am NOT going to accept it, because that's not how *I* AM!"

That was probably 20 years ago and she doesn't say "that's just how things are" to me anymore because once I articulated that, I never stopped saying it to her.
