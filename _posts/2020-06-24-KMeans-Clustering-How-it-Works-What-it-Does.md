## What is KMeans Clustering?

KMeans Clustering is a clustering algorithm, which is to say it takes points of data, and tries to discern groups, or clusters, of those points which fit inside areas of equal size. The reason a clustering algorithm like KMeans would be used in the case of, say, analyzing data, is when graphs such as bar graphs or frequency graphs aren't showing the whole picture. In cases where KMeans might be useful, it may seem at first glance that there are no correlations between two variables when in actuality, there __is__ a pattern, just not a linear one.
