Hi there, fellow readers! This is the first blogspot which I'm putting out for this new website. It's being low due from my side.  Lately, I've been a bit quiet on the career front, but fear not! I've been working behind the scenes to chart my course towards even greater heights.After spending the past few years learning and growing at my current company, I feel it's time to take my career to the next level. And what better way to keep track of my progress than with this very blog?

## Here's what I plan to do with my blog 
- Most important of all to track my progress in learning about digital payments. i.e., ISO20022
- Also, My journey to be able to crack a product management role. 


## Track my progress of daily new learning and talk about different interesting topics. 
- I do love photography and I wanna talk about it in depth. Although I do have [Behance](https://www.behance.net/shivamnema) where I mostly keep my picture collection and I do have my  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shivamnema/). However, I will talk about pro/cons of both the platfroms in greater depth in future.
- I'm also a ardent football fan and my favorite football team is Manchester City. So, I might also wanna talk about it every now and then. 
- I'm also into blockchain/AI so I will about talk that.
- I will definetely going to talk a lot about mental health and its impact on my daily life.
- I do read a lot of books too. So, Here and there I try to write about book reviews. Which would be interesting as I've done that before. 

So, Here is mostly what I will talk about in my blog spot. I'll try to keep mostly to top two points but who knows considering my mind is cursed with multiple interests. 

Signing off.
