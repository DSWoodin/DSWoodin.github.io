 [Psychological First Aid Online](https://learn.nctsn.org/enrol/index.php?id=38). Free, about six hours long. Hosted by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and promoted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 

You learn how to help disaster survivors get referenced to the professionals they need and how to triage those with more damaging psychological distress before it gets worse. Learn the signs, symptoms, etc., and know where to forward the survivors to the proper agencies. Additionally there are some things on how to secure relief sites in consideration for physical and mental health.

There are also free courses on the website regarding helping children and military families with specific issues, but since I have not taken them yet I cannot comment on those classes.

EDIT: Yes, the class teaches you how to deal with both children and adults. Due to the nature of the training, psychological first aid can be comfortably taught online because there are no physical demands. I completed this in a day to enhance my resume for a masters program in psychology a while back. It looks very sharp on a resume. I hope this helps!

EDIT: The course is tailored to the U.S., but the ideas should be easily applicable anywhere. Anyone may register for a class online and take it at their own pace. If there are any issues, please let me know so I may update this post.

EDIT: Psychological First Aid is more designed towards a large-scale response. For individual psychological training, consider the [QTR Institute](https://www.qprinstitute.com/professional-training) which trains you in suicide prevention techniques in multiple different settings and environments. PFA for large-scale, QTR for small-scale.
