## Abstract

The detection of erawitational waves by LIGO and Virgo in the culmination of a decades=long contirms directly Enstein based on classical relativity.. cne may wender hat are gravitationa are quantized and whether they can be detectable. When grawity is. There inevitably comections to the classical Newtonian interactions induced by quantum awitational vacuum fluctuations and spontaneous emission of by hydrogen and helium in the fecombination which is a matural souree of high frequency graveabonal wawes. In talk, we review our of these gravity ellects.
