**VIRTUAL FUR SQUARED 2021&nbsp; VOLUNTEERS**

Are you Interested in making a difference with our growing convention? Fur Squared is staffed entirely by volunteers. Won't you help us out by volunteering? It's easy, fun and there are some great benefits to pitching in. There are plenty of opportunities available for all of our attendees.

**Virtual Warm & Fuzzies**\:&nbsp; Finding your way around a large virtual space in unfamiliar territory can be baffling; especially in a virtual world as large as this one. People always have questions, ranging from where and when panels are, to how to get in touch with staff, and even to making restaurant recommendations. If you like helping people, and making your fellow furries convention experience as stress-free as possible, we can use your help.

**Virtual Duties As Assigned:** Filling in for staff for those unforeseen events which invariably come up, or just pitching in for odd jobs as they arise.&nbsp;

What's in it for you? First off, you'll have the thanks of our entire staff and all our attendees, as well as the knowledge that you helped run the best Virtual Fur Squared yet\! However, there are other benefits too. For volunteering, you will receive the following:

* A ribbon identifying you as being part of our group of convention volunteers
* For 2 hours of logged service, you will Small Sponsor Gift (our dice bag and a glow necklace from our 2nd year)
* For 6 hours of logged service, you will receive a T-shirt with exclusive artwork designed by one of our guests of honor
* For 10 hours of logged service, you will receive a Sponsor Stuff Bag (rest of the sponsor swag)
* For 12 hours of logged service, you will receive Free Registration for Fur Squared 2021

Any hours logged before opening ceremonies or after closing ceremonies will count as **double hours** toward your total hours of logged service.&nbsp;&nbsp;
