Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher specializing in energy systems, policy design, and techno-economic modeling.

## Research

My research aims to enable evidence-based decision making. I study sustainable energy systems, the effects of alternative policy choices, and how to design climate policy that best meets societal goals. 

I take a systems engineering approach and integrate tools from other disciplines including economics, data science, and political science.

## Bio

I am currently a Senior Research Associate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](http://ceepr.mit.edu) and soon an electrical power engineering PhD Candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([Energy System Planning group](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel/research)) on electric vehicle integration in power systems. I am also a certified Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com), where I provide probabilistic predictions on world events.

Previously, I was a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, where I advised public and private sector decision makers on carbon markets. 

I have testified in front of legislators on climate policy, served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing, and briefed senior staff at Fortune Global 500 companies. I advised on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System and my work was featured in policy hearings in the EU Parliament and the EU Commission, contributing to, in the words of one lawmaker: "a cool-headed debate". My research has also been quoted in the media including in Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.
