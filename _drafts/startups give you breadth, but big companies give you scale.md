When push comes to shove, the legal structure of all capitalist entities is to maximize shareholder wealth. Startups are only pursuing a non-wealth returning cause as long as the majority of shareholders say they are. Employees (aka the missionaries) never own the majority. When you inject capital that demands billion-dollar returns, the divine text shifts from the mission statement to the term sheet.

Working at a company that isn’t depending on its employees sacrificing themselves to its “greater good,” and where employees don’t have to deal with the existential threat of their company always being on the edge of failure, strong work/life boundaries are much more possible

Yes, startups give you breadth, but big companies give you scale.


Startup politics are about making the founder like/respect you enough so they will give you permission to get things done. The question you have to ask yourself is: would you rather appease one person who has barely any check on their power OR a group of individuals who need to be aligned on the same objective?
