I recently walked away from a friendship with a person I cared very much about (and continue to care a lot about) because my emotional needs were not being met, largely because she didn’t seem to think my company was worth seeking out. I do need to feel like a relationship has a similar level of affection on both ends to feel comfortable.”

It is damaging and erasing to tell asexual people that being assumed heterosexual and experiencing heterosexual privilege is really the same as being heterosexual (and therefore they shouldn’t expect and shouldn’t get help or understanding and are stepping on toes by hoping to access support). This

if an asexual person brings up something oppressive or discriminatory that has happened to them as a result of being asexual, they will often be told their unfortunate experience was not due to them being asexual.

Asexual people may become withdrawn from communicating with co-workers because they were alienated by pressure to disclose sexual exploits at work, and eventually they are fired for not being a team player: “That wasn’t anti-asexual prejudice. That was motivated by their failure to fit in the culture, not asexual discrimination.”

Asexual people’s orientation is almost always considered the least relevant aspect of their identity, and therefore, it is rarely accepted as the cause of their negative experiences.

Aspects of identity are inextricably intersectional.

It’s very easy as someone who is not in the affected population to say “I see how my oppression affects me, but I don’t believe yours is affecting you because it is irrelevant and invisible to me, so I refuse to consider that it is real.”

“I’ve just never met anyone I’m interested in that way, and I’m fine with that for now.”

You shouldn’t have to prove how you feel, feel as though your critic is automatically right if you can’t express yourself effectively, or feel that their education is your responsibility.

ask them why they are not willing to educate themselves if they still expect you to listen to their objections.

Act disappointed that they apparently can’t be bothered to listen to you since they’re so intent on talking at you.
