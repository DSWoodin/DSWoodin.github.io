  For my example of bad design, I have chosen the page for viewing and editing one's meal plan from the Williams College PeopleSoft site. This page is likely only accessible by students, although it can be found by logging into <https://sarah.williams.edu> and navigating to the main menu, then clicking "Self Service" followed by "Campus Life", "Dining Services", and finally, "My Board Plan". Below is an image of the My Board Plan page. This takes you to the "My Board Plan" page, shown below.

![Bad Design (PeopleSoft Meal Plan Page)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samzgrunebaum/samzgrunebaum.github.io/master/_posts/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-10%20at%205.00.25%20PM.png)

  This page is used for one purpose – to show a student what their current meal plan is and to allow them to change it, should it be the time period in which students are allowed to do so. The page will be accessed at varying points by most Williams students. Williams students are a fairly diverse group of young people with the common characteristic of being students at this school. We can assume that Williams students are educated and familiar with computers, the Internet, and many types of modern technology. The purpose of this page should be to clearly convey the information that will be relevant to students who navigate to it. 

  However, this page is not well designed. Instead of centrally displaying the student's current meal plan, the page shows "My Most Recent Board Plan" in the top left corner of the page. The text is bolded but is displayed below a larger heading showing the student's name and to the left of a note explaining that the most recent board plan is displayed and that study away meals are not shown. However, the information is not current, as it is displaying the plan from last semester rather than the current one (Spring 2018 instead of Fall 2018). While this is clearly shown above, it is not clear how to access the information for Fall 2018 and there is no information about why it may not be current, how to troubleshoot, or who to contact for more information. This information is vaguely stated below in the outdated note "Board Plan offerings have been restructured as of Fall 2017. Please consult the dining services web page if you have questions." The bold text suggests that this note is urgent but it is referring to a year-old change. Additionally, there is no link provided to the page simply referred to as "the dining services web page".
  
  Perhaps most confusing is the box on the left of the page below the heading "New Board Plan". This heading is awkwardly placed such that it is not obvious that it corresponds to this box. The box itself is also confusing and seems as though it is not supposed to be there – it says "Board changes will be allowed during these dates:" with a heading for "Start Date" and "End Date", but there are no dates given. This suggests that the time has passed, but this is not stated anywhere. Below the box with dates is the heading "Reasons for Changing", which is bolded. This is confusing as there are no actual options to change the plan anywhere on the page. However, it is possible to check boxes, answer questions, and type text into the appropriate boxes on the page. There is also a functional "Save" button at the bottom of the page.
  
  This design is confusing because it displays some information while leaving other relevant information opaque. It appears that the page is not currently usable for its intended purpose, but this is not stated anywhere. There are textfields and clickable boxes to be selected that are all functional but do not seem to correspond to any real purpose. It seems as though the page sometimes functions for changing meal plans and at other times displays a shell of the functional page that can be interacted with but cannot actually change the plan.
  
  A better design for this page would clearly state when the page is usable and when it is not. If it was going to display outdated information, it would include some kind of message that the information may not be exactly current. Otherwise, it would display accurate, current information. Additionally, the overall design of the page is lackluster and looks very retro. This can be stylish but there is a lot of blank space on the page and many headings and labels are spaced awkwardly in relation to the elements that they correspond to. The menus at the top are also very small and are fairly confusingly named ("Self Service", "Campus Life"). There are fun options like "Personalize Page" and "Favorites" but these are not displayed very prominently or in a fun way. Another way to improve this page would be to liven up the aesthetic design and fill more of the space with useful links and information.
