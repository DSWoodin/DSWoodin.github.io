 The primary idea is:

* Menial Task - High Skill Level = Relaxing
* Menial Task - Low Skill Level = Apathy
* Hard Task - Low Skill Level = Anxiety
* Hard Task - High Skill Level = Flow

So the idea would be to challenge yourself with a task that has an appropriate response.

That, and be high skilled at stuff!
