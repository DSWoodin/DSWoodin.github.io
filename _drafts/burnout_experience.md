 You and me, I think we're the exact fucking same.

I have an hour long commute. I have to wake up at 5 am, leave at 6 am, and be in by 7. I leave at 3 pm, and make it home at 4. I have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing.

The instant I get home at 4:30 pm, my mind goes into timer mode. I start counting the hours, the minutes, sometimes even the seconds. I have exactly four and a half hours to do things I want to do before I have to go back to the slog the next day. I need to cram that time with as much of the things I want to do as possible.

My weekends are the same. I wake up, and I start counting. Saturdays are less of a problem usually because I can wake up when I want and go to sleep whenever I want, but it's still there casting a shadow over everything. I get one day. One day out of seven where I don't feel stressed about waking up when I have to and sleeping when I have to. And when Saturday starts, I have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before Sunday. When Sunday starts, I have until 9 pm until my weekend is over.

When the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me, you start feeling stifled for time, and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless, because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back. 

This is your life, ending one hour, one minute, one second at a time, for forty hours a week. Maybe even more.

If anyone asks you out, whether it's your SO or your friends, your parents, anyone, even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy, your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation. How much of my time will this take? How much will I have left until I have to go back to work? And when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store, if there's traffic, if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time, you start to resent it. You resent that delay, and the people who caused that delay, for wasting the precious free time you have, and every hour, every minute, every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do.

Things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment, because you can't stop that clock. You can't stop counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds. Even if you're enjoying yourself, even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot, even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream, that shadow is there, telling you that *you only have this many hours, this many minutes, this many seconds left until you go back*. Like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck. And when you're having fun, that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world.

Hey, fucker. Have a good time? I hope you did, because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back. Now start lifting, jackass. Your life doesn't become yours until we say it does.

My job doesn't suck. The work is nothing special, if a little tiring, but it's not murdering me. I work at a good company, my co workers are good people, my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can. My pay isn't anything stellar but it's liveable, and some people would envy having it ($20 an hour). 

But I get the sense that I'd feel like this with the vast majority of work. Forty hour work weeks, no matter what, get tedious, become meaningless, burn me out. The only way I can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that I love. But how many people get jobs they love? How many people get paid liveable wages, enough to have a room and food, doing what they love? How many people even *know* what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place?

The fact that the starving artist is a running joke in America--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality. And the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else, even fake laughter, is the cruelest reality imaginable.

You want to do what you love? Fuck you. That's not how the real fucking world works, shitheel. Now hop to it, you've got forty hours of work to do, and if you want to fucking eat, you better fucking do it.

I'm reminded of that movie *In Time*, starring Justin Timberlake. It's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning, and people trade time. A coffee might cost thirty seconds, a cab fare might cost two minutes, a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months, a new sedan might be nine years.

There's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have, and when the number reaches zero, they die. Some people have hundreds of years of time. Some people live minute to minute.

That's what I feel like. That some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to, with their 90 years of time, and here I am, scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and I die. 

And in America, you can't talk to anyone about it. Nobody at all. Not really. Because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you, society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others. All because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week, one hundred and sixty hours a month, one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck. And you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck, that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills. You try, you try so *hard* to justify it. You need this money. You need to give up these forty hours to live. This is necessary. You try.

But it doesn't work. Not really. Not until it's too late.

I've been trying to search for a job where I can work from a home office. But for someone like me, there's no options. Everything requires more schooling, more experience, and getting schooling or experience requires time and money I don't have and can't get. And even then, I've only been at this job for a few months. I can't quit yet because I need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume.

I know drugs will make it worse. Alcohol will make it worse. The most I can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that I used to like, activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose. I used to enjoy these things, but now the most these things can give me--these things I used to love and enjoy--is a distraction. A temporary illusion that I'm not miserable, which wears off at 9 pm every day.

There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I can only hope that it's a train.
