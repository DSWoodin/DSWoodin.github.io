Dysfunctional Belief: Your degree determines your career.
Reframe: Three-quarters of all college grads don’t end up working in a career related to their majors.

Dysfunctional Belief: If you are successful, you will be happy.
Reframe: True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you.

Dysfunctional Belief: It’s too late.
Reframe: It’s never too late to design a life you love.

when emotions are involved, design thinking has proved to be the best problem-solving tool.

A well-designed life is a life that is generative—it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise.

“Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.”

“Who or what do you want to grow into?”

A well-designed life is not a life of drudgery. You weren’t put on this earth to work eight hours a day at a job you hate until the time comes to die.

The five mind-sets you are going to learn in order to design your life are curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration.

for most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery—not before.

passion is the result of a good life design, not the cause.

Problem Finding + Problem Solving = Well-Designed Life

people waste a lot of time working on the wrong problem.

If they are unlucky and smart, they’ll succeed—we call it the success disaster—and wake up ten years later wondering how the hell they got to wherever they are, and why they are so unhappy.

If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem.

Lifeview is simply your ideas about the world and how it works. What gives life meaning? What makes your life worthwhile or valuable? How does your life relate to others in your family, your community, and the world? What do money, fame, and personal accomplishment have to do with a satisfying life? How important are experience, growth, and fulfillment in your life?

A coherent life is one lived in such a way that you can clearly connect the dots between three things:
• Who you are
• What you believe
• What you are doing

Living coherently doesn’t mean everything is in perfect order all the time. It simply means you are living in alignment with your values and have not sacrificed your integrity along the way.

A Workview may address such questions as:
• Why work?
• What’s work for?
• What does work mean?
• How does it relate to the individual, others, society?
• What defines good or worthwhile work?
• What does money have to do with it?
• What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with it?

Lifeview is what provides your definition of what have been called “matters of ultimate concern.” It’s what matters most to you.
• Why are we here?
• What is the meaning or purpose of life?
• What is the relationship between the individual and others?
• Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?
• What is good, and what is evil?
• Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?
• What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?

Where do your views on work and life complement one another?
• Where do they clash?
• Does one drive the other? How?

Dysfunctional Belief: I should know where I’m going!
Reframe: I won’t always know where I’m going—but I can always know whether I’m going in the right direction.

Dysfunctional Belief: Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that’s why they call it work.
Reframe: Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you.

first clues are engagement and energy.

When you learn what activities reliably engage you, you’re discovering and articulating something that can be very helpful in your life design work.

People in flow report the experience as having these sorts of attributes:
• Experiencing complete involvement in the activity.
• Feeling a sense of ecstasy or euphoria.
• Having great inner clarity—knowing just what to do and how to do it.
• Being totally calm and at peace.
• Feeling as if time were standing still—or disappearing in an instant.

flow experiences have a special place in designing your life, so it’s important to get good at capturing them in your Good Time Journal.

we want to track those energy flows as part of our Good Time Journal exercise.

Work is fun when you are actually leaning into your strengths and are deeply engaged and energized by what you’re doing.

There are two elements to the Good Time Journal:
• Activity Log (where I record where I’m engaged and energized)
• Reflections (where I discover what I am learning)

The Activity Log simply lists your primary activities and how engaged  and energized  you were by those activities.

The second element of the Good Time Journal is reflection, looking over your Activity Log and noticing trends, insights, surprises—anything that is a clue to what does and doesn’t work for you.

Activities. What were you actually doing? Was this a structured or an unstructured activity? Did you have a specific role to play (team leader) or were you just a participant (at the meeting)?
Environments. Our environment has a profound effect on our emotional state. You feel one way at a football stadium, another in a cathedral. Notice where you were when you were involved in the activity. What kind of a place was it, and how did it make you feel?
Interactions. What were you interacting with—people or machines? Was it a new kind of interaction or one you are familiar with? Was it formal or informal?
Objects. Were you interacting with any objects or devices—iPads or smartphones, hockey sticks or sailboats? What were the objects that created or supported your feeling engaged?
Users. Who else was there, and what role did they play in making it either a positive or a negative experience?

I need a lot of ideas so that I can explore any number of possibilities for my future.

stuck because he’s anchored himself to a solution that can’t work.

Don’t make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn’t working. Reframe the solution to some other possibilities, prototype those ideas (take some test hikes), and get yourself unstuck.

Sometimes it is more comfortable to hold on to our familiar, failed approach to the problem than to risk a worse failure by attempting the big changes that we think will be required to eliminate it.

An anchor problem is a real problem, just a hard one. It’s actionable—but we’ve been stuck on it so long or so often that it seems insurmountable (which is why such a problem has to be reframed, then opened up with new ideas, then knocked down to size by prototyping). Gravity problems aren’t actually problems. They’re circumstances that you can do nothing to change.

The conclusion is that if your mind starts with multiple ideas in parallel, it is not prematurely committed to one path and stays more open and able to receive and conceive more novel innovations.

most people’s lives are actually lived as a series of two-to-four-year seasons strung together.

Good prototypes isolate one aspect of a problem and design an experience that allows you to “try out” some version of a potentially interesting future.

we prototype to ask good questions, create experiences, reveal our assumptions, fail fast, fail forward, sneak up on the future, and build empathy for ourselves and others. Once you accept that this is really the only way to get the data you need, prototyping becomes an integral part of your life design process.

A Life Design Interview is incredibly simple. It just means getting someone’s story. Not just anyone and not just any story, of course. You want to talk to someone who is either doing and living what you’re contemplating, or has real experience and expertise in an area about which you have questions. And the story you’re after is the personal story of how that person got to be doing that thing he or she does, or got the expertise he has and what it’s really like to do what she does.

You want to hear what the person who does what you might someday want to do loves and hates about his job. You want to know what her days look like, and then you want to see if you can imagine yourself doing that job—and loving it—for months and years on end. In addition to asking people about their work and life, you will also be able to find out how they got there—their career path. Most people fail not for lack of talent but for lack of imagination.

Prototype experiences allow us to learn through a direct encounter with a possible future version of us. This experiential version could involve spending a day shadowing a professional you’d like to be (Take a Friend to Work Day), or a one-week unpaid exploratory project that you create, or a three-month internship (obviously, a three-month internship requires more investment and a larger commitment).

Life design brainstorming has four steps, and a very structured approach to coming up with lots of prototypable ideas. Typically, if you are the facilitator who brings the group together, you might have already framed the brainstorming topic. You want a team of no fewer than three and rarely more than six people who have all volunteered to help. Once the group is convened, the session proceeds as follows.
1. Framing a Good Question

If the question isn’t open-ended, you won’t get very interesting results and not much volume. We tend to start all of our life design brainstorms with the phrase “How many ways can we think of to…” to make sure that we haven’t limited our potential output.

You also want to be careful not to include your solution accidentally in your question.

be careful that you don’t frame a question so broadly that it is meaningless.

Warming Up
People need a transition from their hectic, event-driven workday to a state of relaxed, creative attention if they are going to do a good job brainstorming.

for a list of exercises and improvisational games that we use all the time with our students.

The Rules of Brainstorming
1. Go for quantity, not quality.
2. Defer judgment and do not censor ideas.
3. Build off the ideas of others.
4. Encourage wild ideas.

Ideas should be counted—you want to be able to say, “We had 141 ideas.” Group similar ideas together by subject or category, name those categories, and frame the results with reference to the original focal question. Every unique category is given a descriptive and often funny name that captures the essence of that group of ideas. Then vote. Voting is important, and should be done silently, so that people aren’t influencing one another. We like to use colored dots to cast votes, and we also like to use categories such as:
• Most exciting
• The one we wish we could do if money were no object
• The dark horse—probably won’t work, but if it did…
• Most likely to lead to a great life
• If we could ignore the laws of physics…
Once the voting is complete, the selections are discussed, and potentially regrouped and framed again; then decisions are made on what to prototype first.

52 percent of employers have admitted that they respond to fewer than half of the candidates that apply.

Using the Internet as your only job-finding method is nothing short of masochistic.

1. The job description on the website is typically not written by the hiring manager or someone who really understands the job.
2. The job description almost never captures what the job actually requires for success.

This part of the job description is always based on the skills of the previous jobholder; it’s historical. It does not take into account the possibility that the job will change in the future, or that the very specific knowledge required would be irrelevant in six months, when the company changes from one software platform to another. Nor does it account for the fact that office procedures and other methods of operation constantly evolve in any healthy, growing company.

This role is not for the faint of heart, and only those with a proven and successful track record should apply.
We call this the “You’d have to be crazy to take this job” qualifier. It really means “This job really sucks, and only people who have a proven track record of surviving sucky jobs should apply.”
• Looking for: superheroes with the ability to produce ridiculous amounts of work on ludicrously tight deadlines.
This “superhero” qualifier should be read as “This job is impossible, and no one can do it.”
• On top of your ability to create elegant and inspiring solutions, you are insightful and persuasive when analyzing and discussing strategies with colleagues.
We call this the “wishful thinking” qualifier. We’ve never met a job seeker who didn’t think he or she was insightful and persuasive, elegant and inspiring. It’s nice that we all think of ourselves this way, but it’s not much help when you’re screening candidates.

that, if you want to be discovered, you need to describe yourself with the same words that the company uses.

Tip 1: Rewrite your résumé using the same words used in the job posting.

Tip 2: If you have a specific skill that is posted as required, put it in your résumé exactly the way it is written in the Internet posting.

Tip 3: Focus your résumé on the job as described.

Tip 4: Always bring a fresh, nicely printed copy of your résumé to an interview.

One way is to do some research and find out how long the job has been posted. In a good labor market, a job posting should never be open for more than four weeks (six at the max).
Another is to find out how many people have already been interviewed. Both data points will give you a sense of what’s going on behind the scenes.

One way to tell if this is happening is to find out how quickly job descriptions churn on a company’s website. If they are coming and going every week or two, this might be the reason.

Mistakenly letting a great candidate go doesn’t cost a cool company a thing: they have plenty of spare great candidates, so letting a few spill on the ground is a much better mistake to make than hiring a bad candidate. Therefore, cool companies’ hiring processes are sometimes rather draconian. Great people get rejected frequently,

“What steps would be involved in exploring how someone like me might become a part of this organization?,”

Dysfunctional Belief: Networking is just hustling people—it’s slimy.
Reframe: Networking is just asking for directions.

Multiple studies confirm this—most of us like being helpful.

Every domain of human endeavor is held together by a web of relationships between people.

The most common way for people to be introduced across professional networks is by referrals from personal networks. This isn’t favoritism—it’s just communal behavior.

The network exists to sustain the community of people getting the work done—and is the only way to gain access to the hidden job market.

Use the Internet not to get online job listings but to find and reach out to the people whose stories you want to hear.

there is no way to know the real “nature of the work” before you have gotten very close to actually getting the job. It’s impossible.

Dysfunctional Belief: I am looking for a job.
Reframe: I am pursuing a number of offers.

It shifts you from being a person deciding whether or not you’d take this job (which you know nothing about) to being a person who is curious to find out what kind of interesting offer you might be able to find in that organization. It flips you from judging to exploring, from negative to positive—and that’s a huge difference.

You can be genuinely curious about the job, because it is absolutely true that you would like the opportunity to evaluate an offer.

being open and curious about the possibilities. We call it pursuing latent wonderfulness.

The idea that your dream job already exists, fully formed, just waiting for you to find it, is a fairy tale.

The secret to happiness in life design isn’t making the right choice; it’s learning to choose well.

All of your hard work can be undone by poor choosing. Not so much by making the wrong choice (that’s a risk, but, frankly, not a big one, and usually one you can recover from) as by thinking wrongly about your choosing.

Dysfunctional Belief: To be happy, I have to make the right choice.
Reframe: There is no right choice—only good choosing.

In life design, the choosing process has four steps. First you gather and create some options, then you narrow down your list to your top alternatives, then you finally choose,

The fourth step in the process is to let go of our unnecessary options and move on, embracing our choice fully so that we can get the most from it.

most minds can choose effectively between only three to five options. If we’re faced with more than that, our ability to make a choice begins to wane—many more than that and our ability to choose completely freezes.

options only actually create value in your life when they are chosen and realized. We often teach our students that when an option grows up it becomes a choice.

First, if it turns out that a lot of your options group together into categories, you can break your list down into smaller sublists.

We define discernment as decision making that employs more than one way of knowing. We mostly use cognitive knowing—all that good, objective, organized, informational kind of knowing—the sort of knowing that gets you A’s in school. But we also have other ways of knowing, including the affective forms of intuitive, spiritual, and emotional knowing. Add to those both social knowing (with others) and kinesthetic knowing (in our bodies).

Rarely do people get access to their deepest wisdom by rushing around a few hours before a deadline and talking a lot or surfing the Web. It’s a slower, quieter thing.

In his 1960s sci-fi classic Stranger in a Strange Land, Robert Heinlein invented the word “grok” to describe a way of knowing that Martians employ. It means to understand something deeply and completely, so much so that you feel you’ve become one with it.

reversibility is not conducive to establishing reliable happiness with a decision.

The key is to remember that imagined choices don’t actually exist, because they’re not actionable.

Happiness is letting go of what you don’t need.

grit is a better measure of potential success than IQ.

This is the first level of failure immunity—using a bias to action, failing fast, and being so clear on the learning value of a failure that the sting disappears (and, of course, you learn from the failure quickly and incorporate improvements).

big failure immunity, which comes from understanding the really big reframe in design thinking. Are you ready? Designing your life is actually what life is, because life is a process, not an outcome.

Dysfunctional Belief: We judge our life by the outcome.
Reframe: Life is a process, not an outcome.

The philosopher James Carse wrote an interesting book called Finite and Infinite Games.2 In it he asserts that just about everything we do in life is either a finite game, one in which we play by the rules in order to win—or an infinite game, one in which we play with the rules for the joy of getting to keep playing.

With the infinite-game mind-set, you are not just adept at failure reduction—you are truly failure-immune. Sure, you’ll experience pain and loss or serious setbacks, but they won’t make you less of a person, and you don’t experience these setbacks as an existential “failure” from which you can’t recover.

This diagram is, we think, a better way to imagine the process:


he doesn’t ever believe that he is a failure or that failure defines him, or, in fact, that his failures were failures. His failures educate him in just the same way that his successes do. He likes success better, but he’ll take whatever he gets and just keep failing his way forward.

1. Log your failures.
2. Categorize your failures.
3. Identify growth insights.

Screwups are just that—simple mistakes about things that you normally get right.

some failures are just part of your makeup, and your best strategy is avoidance of the situations that prompt them instead of improvement.

Growth opportunities are the failures that didn’t have to happen, or at least don’t have to happen the next time. The cause of these failures is identifiable, and a fix is available.

Dysfunctional Belief: It’s my life, I have to design it myself.
Reframe: You live and design your life in collaboration with others.

Supporters.

Supporters are just those go-to people you can count on to care about your life—people close enough to you that their encouragement helps keep you going and their feedback is of real use.

Players. Players are the active participants in your life design projects—especially your ongoing work-related and avocational projects and prototypes. These are the people you actually do things with, your co-workers in the classic sense.

Intimates. Intimates include your immediate and close extended family members and your closest friends.

As far as rules go, we use just four in our Stanford teams (which we call sections).
Keep it:
1. Respectful
2. Confidential
3. Participative (no holding back)
4. Generative (constructive, not skeptical or judging)

“Counsel” is when someone is trying to help you figure out what you think. “Advice” is when someone is telling you what he or she thinks.

Discernment.

You can find topical mentors (parenting, finances, spirituality, etc.), and you can find ad hoc or seasonal mentors

You just have to be the initiator. When you identify someone who you think can serve you as a mentor, find a way to spend some time with the person and direct the conversation to the areas in which you want help. Specifically, ask him not so much to tell you what he’d do as to use his insights and experience to try to help you sort out your own thinking.

Community is more than just sharing resources or hanging out now and then. It’s showing up and investing in the ongoing creation of one another’s lives.

(1) be curious (curiosity), (2) try stuff (bias to action), (3) reframe problems (reframing), (4) know it’s a process (awareness), and (5) ask for help (radical collaboration).

Are you on the right step, or are you ahead of or behind yourself?

What’s the worst thing that can happen? How likely is it to happen, and what would you do if it did?
What’s the best thing that can happen?

Build a team.
Create a community.
Who are all the different groups and constituencies involved in what you’re working on? Are you connected to and in conversation with all of them? If not—get going.
Keep an ask-for-help journal in which you jot down the questions you want help on, and keep it handy. Each week, identify some people who can help you with some of the journal entries and reach out to them. Journal answers and results from your helpers.
Find a mentor.
Call your mother (she’d love it—you know she would).

Your compass is about those great big organizing ideas of your Workview and Lifeview. These, along with your values, provide the foundation for your answer to “How’s it going?” They inform you if you are on a good track for you, or are out of sync with yourself. They determine if you’re living a coherent life in which you’ve got who you are, what you believe, and what you’re doing in adequate alignment.

invest in and commit to some personal practices

appreciation of the value of such practices (yoga, meditation, poetry writing/reading, prayer, etc.) is gaining ground, this remains an area of great weakness, especially in modern society.
