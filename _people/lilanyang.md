# Bio

Lilan Yang, a PhD student at Wuhan University. Clusters of galaxies can be used as giant magnifying glasses, by exploiting the gravitational lensing effects. Sources behind intermediate redshift clusters can be magnified by factors up to ~50, thus appearing larger and brighter.Studying background sources helps to understand earlier universe, e.g., formation and evolution of galaxies, reionization etc. Even though there has been a lot of progress on modeling lensing clusters there are still gains to be made in improving source reconstruction. In cluster lensing at the moment most models tend to be global models based on source position, not on the detailed structure of each multiply imaged source. Wehave developed an algorithm to improve source reconstruction, implement it in python and then apply it to new data to be obtained with the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope. Applying our tool, we derive samples with redshift z 2~4 from Hubble Front Field. We perform source reconstruction and study size-luminosity scaling relation and its evolution.
