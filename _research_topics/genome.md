In the last several years, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying associations between common variants and common diseases.  However, this type of study is not without drawbacks, particularly the problem of *missing heritability*: most GWAS associations have small effect sizes that can't fully explain heritability of a particular phenotype.  There are several strategies available to help resolve this dillema.
