 When I was first starting out, I’d ask the seniors on my team how long something should take according to them and I’d let them know that if I wasn’t at least on track to complete it with minimally perceived blockers by that point, I’d reach out for help. It gives you a good reference point to aim for and also keeps the work moving along so you’re not suddenly a day behind expectations. Just my 2¢
