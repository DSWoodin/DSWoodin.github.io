I don't find a lot of material specific to technical management since it's no different than normal management for skilled workers. (Edit: I lied. The first two books in the reading list are EM specific.)

An engineering background helps you gain the team's trust if you can demonstrate competency, identify risk or ask good clarifying questions in planning or design, and more thoroughly understand tradeoffs as it pertains to priorities and roadmaps.

One exception is the technical lead manager (TLM) which tends to exist in early stage startups, small engineering teams (2-3 eng), or Google. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I've been in Bay Area tech for a decade, and a manager for half that period at a few companies so the advice tends to skew for that environment.

I have an email I copy/paste for friends and coworkers that switch into management and have gotten pretty good responses over the years, shared below. I've also posted this in Slack manager channels at multiple companies so if you've seen this before, please don't dox me. ಠ_ಠ
