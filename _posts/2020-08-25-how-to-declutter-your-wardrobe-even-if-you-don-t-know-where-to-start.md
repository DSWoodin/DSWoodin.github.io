Wardrobes. Clothing. Is your wardrobe busting at the seams and you want to simplify but have no clue where to start? Today on the blog, I'm going to go over how you can declutter your wardrobe even if you don't know where to start. I'll also be sharing tips from one of the top minimalist living folk, [Joshua Becker](www.becomingminimalist.com) and drawing from my own experience with going through a mega wardrobe declutter.

  
**It's simple, but not easy - guidelines to get you started**

These are simple guidelines, but not easy, especially if you are new to fine tuning your wardrobe, but write them down, and keep them in mind if you really want to make changes or make your own rules and use these as a guide. 

_Doesn't fit? Gone._ 

_Ripped, broken zippers and not easily fixed? Gone._

_Colour awful on you? Gone._ 

_Haven't worn in 12 months? Gone._

_Too many of? Gone._

_Out of style, trend that you no longer enjoy? Gone. Focus on timely pieces you have._

  
When I went through this process, I kept in mind what works for me NOW as a home business owner, homeschooling mom, and purged a ton of professional clothes, to boot!  
You can also find more tips [here](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/thin-closet/) from Joshua Becker's Becoming Minimalist website that you may find helpful. Also Courtney Carver’s book [Project 333](https://amzn.to/2ZdURKp) on developing minimalist wardrobes may be helpful too.

_And if your wardrobe needs a total rehaul and you have a hard time knowing where to start, you may enjoy my Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide. Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” If you’d like that guide, feel free to email me at simplehomemom@gmail.com and I can send that off to you._

  
Cheers,

Kelly
