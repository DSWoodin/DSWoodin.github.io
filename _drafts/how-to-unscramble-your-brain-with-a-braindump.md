Scrambled eggs brain. Does this sound familiar sometimes? I know it does for me. We may feel scrambled when we have a lot on our brains – when we're thinking about all of the tasks and ideas that keep floating around. And then the next thing we know, we forget what they were. Sound familiar? Today on the blog, I'm sharing about _how to unscramble your brain with a braindump._

> “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.” - [David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), author of [_Getting Things Done_](https://fourminutebooks.com/getting-things-done-summary/#:\~:text=1%2DSentence%2DSummary%3A%20Getting,on%20the%20task%20at%20hand.)

#### So what's a braindump?

In my definition: A braindump is essentially writing your "brain down on paper". It’s writing down everything and anything (usually tasks or ideas) that comes to mind that keeps floating around in there. You can get fancier by categorizing or [prioritizing too](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-a-priority-pyramid-can-change-your-life/).

**Other braindump descriptions:**

> Definition of brain dump: the act or an instance of comprehensively and uncritically expressing and recording one's thoughts and ideas (as on a particular topic)  
> Instead, Shafer recommends doing a brain dump—getting workflow, ideas, commitments, and to-do lists out of your head and onto a physical list and calendar.  
> — Stephanie Vozza

> First, you do a giant brain dump to force yourself to clear out the mental clutter and face head-on all the contradictory goals and obligations that are crowding your days.  
> — Jessica Stillman

([from the Merriam Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brain%20dump))

# How to unscramble your brain with a braindump: tips for making braindumps

* Keep a notebook or digital notepad handy for those times you really need to write things down. I'm a big fan of [bullet journaling](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/bullet-journal-guide).
* Add to your braindump as you go throughout the day (because there's nothing more annoying than waking up at 3am remembering something lol! Been there).
* Revisit your braindump when feeling less scrambled eggs and decide what to do with those things. Move, remove, or get done.
