After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I've reached retirement age but I'm still good for the smaller stuff.

Just of the jobs I can do for you:
 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Fit shelving
 - Fix kitchen cabinets
 - Lay tiles
 - Silicone a bath or sink
 - Repair damaged walls or plasterboard
 - Clean up and re-paint a radiator
 
You need something different done? If I can take it on I'll happily give you a quote.

There are certain jobs that I won't take on:
  - Longer jobs (three days maximum is a guide) 
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing (not even tap washers)
  - Double-glazed window or door systems
  - Extensive exterior painting
  - Extensive flooring work
