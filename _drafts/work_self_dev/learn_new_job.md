 The thing you don't get prepared to are

* using Git in the real world

*  PR and code reviews 

* Server issues and configuration

* continuous integration 

* having multiple environments

* using redmine or jira and managing your tickets

*  communication with clients or users

* trying to anticipate side effects

* the stress of putting something in production that have a high impact on users

* the complexity of databases and codebases in businesses, especially when they're quite old, the technical dept is high and legacy code is hard to deal with

Your brand new app that you've made alone in 2 months with a 10 tables database, pushing on master, without project management and hosted on your machine is not training you for that
