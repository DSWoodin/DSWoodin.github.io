I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics, under the supervision of [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/). I am part of the [HeKA Team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/).

I work at the interface between neuroscience and mathematics. More specifically, I focus on adapting shape analysis tools to the quantitative analysis of fetal brain MRI. My goal is to provide better depiction of healthy brain growth and neurodevelopmental anomalies, along with enhanced diagnosis and prenatal counselling.

My research topics include:

- **Riemanian Geometry**
- **Image registration and atlas estimation**
- **Fetal MRI processing.**

Past and present research projects:
- **Multiscale image registration and atlas estimation**
- **Characterizing fetal brains with Corpus Callosum Agenesis - collaboration with Hôpital Trousseau**
- **Investigating healthy developmental trajectories of the fetal brain - collaboration with Hôpital Necker and Institut Lumière**
- **Characterizing fetal brains with Cytomegalovirus infection - collaboration with Hôpital Necker and Institut Lumière**
