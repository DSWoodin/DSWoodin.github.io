  I would recommend these two books to start with:

1. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg 

Book explores how we can change our lives by changing our habits. Great way to start something new.

2. The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results by Gary Keller

Using this simple, powerful concept to focus on what matters most in your personal and work life.
