I'm a software developer and researcher with 5 years of experience using Java and R. I'm interested in the application of machine learning methods for solving real problems, mainly predictive and analytical problems.

These are some examples of what I have done so far:

### Sports

>I love sports. So I've used machine learning methods for interesting tasks, such as predicting the outcome of MLB's games, analyzing pitchers' performance, clustering professional football players, finding patterns in water polo videos, and so on.

### Software Engineering

>Put it simple, software development is based on managing data. I've leveraged the latest data analysis techniques in order to extract useful knowledge from software repositories. Also, I scraped into malware data and studied the malware diversity in major Android markets.

### Bioinformatics

>Biological data represent a motivating challenge due to its complexity. I've developed feature selection methodologies for improving classification accuracy on microarray cancer datasets. I'm currently exploring the advantages of Big Data for dealing with genetic data.

I'm constantly searching for interesting software projects to collaborate with my ideas and code. Feel free of contact me if you are interested in ;)
