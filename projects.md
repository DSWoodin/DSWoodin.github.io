*I'll talk about projects (even some small code bits) I've done in past or currently working on, which I think are pretty cool. If I feel like I need to talk a lot about a project, I'll make a blog post about it as well*

Let's begin

## Machine Learning (also NLP) 


***Predicting NASDAQ Composite movements using News*** [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/anti-mony/NASDAQ-Movement-Prediction)  
I did this project very recently from July-August 2019, where I tried to predict how the NASDAQ Composite index moves based on the news that comes in daily, here is a [blog]() for this.  
***TLDR**: I used RNNs to summarize text and used that to predict +ve/-ve movements of the index, I gathered data from sources online; cleaned and pre-processed it using NLTK and used PyTorch for deep learning.*
