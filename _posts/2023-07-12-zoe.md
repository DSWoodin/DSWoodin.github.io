I've been looking after animals for years, mostly for long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.

#### Pet Sitting
My husband Bill and I will look after your pets in your home. We mainly sit dogs but in the past we've cared for several generations of customers' cats.

Before we start a sit we'll visit you to get to know your pet and, in the case of dogs, join you on  a walk.

We don't take pets into our own home and we are not dog walkers.

 - We charge £35 per day or part of day:
 - A non-returnable £35 deposit secures booking.
 - We sleep overnight in your house.
 - At least one of us stays with your pet through most of each day
 - Dogs get walked up to twice a day.
 - We bring our own food and bedding.
 - We leave your house in the same state as we found it.

We can only sit one house at a time and may be continuously booked so please contact me well in advance.

#### Domestic cleaning
I can do regular or one-off cleans of your house. If you want my husband, Bill, to assist, we can speed the process up but I am equally happy to work by myself.
