# Bio

Prof. Zong-Hong Zhu, the Changjiang Scholar and obtainer of National Distinguished Youth Funds. His research interests are mainly on the gravitational lensing, gravitational waves and cosmology. After joining Wuhan University, the group proposed the strongly lensed gravitational waves to constrain the speed of gravitational waves and the value of the Hubble constant. Recently, our interests focus on the influences of gravitational lensing on the gravitational wave polarizations and relevant applications of strongly lensed repeating fast radio bursts and ultra-compact radio quasars. For the gravitational wave experiment and international collaboration, some members of our group joined KAGRA (Kamioka Gravitational wave detector), which will join the LIGO-Virgo observations at the end of this year. The KAGRA observation duty of the Wuhan university members has been arranged. For the student education, we sent several students to Japan, the UK, Australia and America to study gravitational wave experiment technology and data analysis.
