# Dealer's Den & Artist Alley

Fur Squared has gone digital for 2021, and with this transition comes a new approach to the way we present dealers and artists! We plan to provide an organized list of artists and dealers that includes a short description of each business, links to their online platforms and stores, and examples of the types of products offered. 

In addition to the directory, we will be hosting an Artists & Dealers' stream that will operate the entire run of the convention, dedicated to showcasing offerings from the dealers and artists, and hosting what we're affectionately calling the "multi-multi-multi-stream".  For this, we will be asking for dealers to send us information, photos, and sample products for our presenters to help promote, as well as looking for any on screen help, such as live interviews, Q and A's, and tutorials.

We recognize that virtual platforms present unique difficulties when directing traffic and we are taking steps to provide equivalent visibility to applicants. Since operating Fur Squared virtually is a first for all of us, we would appreciate your feedback and patience as we plan around this new platform. We have a lot of ideas that are taking shape that we are very excited to share with you when they are ready. Due to the nature of an online event, we are committing ourselves this year more than ever to prompt and ongoing communication with you, our valued dealers, to ensure a smooth convention experience.

If you have any feedback or inquiry about the application process or any other related topics, please contact us at [info@fursquared.com](mailto:info@fursquared.com).
