      * theory (risk and return, theory of interest, efficient markets, etc.)
      * history (past bubbles and crashes)
      * psychology (herd mentality, mistakes that investors make, etc.)
      * business (why index funds are awesome, and how to avoid getting ripped off by stock brokers or expensive mutual funds)
      It also focuses on portfolio management: diversification, asset allocation with index funds, rebalancing, retirement planning, etc. So it's a fairly comprehensive book, but is an easy read for someone new to investing.
