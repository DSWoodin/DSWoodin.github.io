Consider any of your software systems under testing as Disneyland Park that you may want to explore. Of course, if you want, you can just buy tickets and visit the park as you wish. While this is fun to do, there is a good chance that you will miss out on interesting places. 

In this case, all you can do is collect a map of the park. The same goes for your project, you need maps to know what to test, what you tested, what you don't need to test. And that's how the idea of ​​preparing a test case comes about. Test cases are considered to be one of the most important parts of software testing. It is used by the QA team, development as well as middle management executives.

If we look at the quality, then the test case is the condition by which one assures that the tested product is functional up to a certain level and ready to go live.
If we look at it from the point of view of a tester, then test cases provide the conditions by which a tester performs the task of verifying the authenticity of a particular function or feature of a system.
 
How to write a software test case:

# Use a clear title
A good test case starts with a clear and strong title. As a standard practice, it is best to name the test case according to the module you are testing. For example, if you check the login page, include "login page" in the title of the test case.

# Include a strong description
Read the description so that the examiner can understand what they are testing. Sometimes this section may include other relevant information such as test environment, test data, and prerequisites/assumptions. Test descriptions should be easy to read and immediately understand the high-level goals and objectives of the test.

# Include estimates and prerequisites
Any assumptions applicable to the test and any prerequisites must be met before the test can be performed. This information may include which page the user should start the test on, depending on the test environment and the need for a special setup before running the test.

# Keep test steps clear and concise
Remember, the person who wrote the test case may not be the one to carry out the test himself. The test steps should include the necessary data and information on how to conduct the test. This is probably the most important part of any test case. Write the test case in such a way that anyone can follow it and test.
Include expected results
Expected Outcomes Tell the examiner what results should be obtained as opposed to their test steps. This is how the examiner determines if the test case has "passed" or "failed".

# Make it reusable
A good test case provides reusable and long-term value to the software testing team. Keep this in mind when writing a test case. You can save a lot of time by reusing the test case instead of rewriting it.
For beginners, the best practice for writing test cases is to read the software requirements document a few times until the requirements are clear and then start writing by identifying the situation based on the information provided in the required documents. For practical convenience, a test case template is provided which you can use in test case preparation.
