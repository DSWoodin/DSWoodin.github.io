 There's a few things you can do here. There are two main strategies:

* Don't dump a great emotional outpouring onto one person (unless they are a paid professional). That can be draining for friends and family. Instead, split your emotional outlet over several trusted people, and do it sparingly. Don't let any single relationship be entirely about emotional release. Learning to express how you feel is a walk in the mountains, not a sprint on a race-track.
* Choose your trusted confidantes carefully. Not everyone is comfortable with helping people with their emotional labour, perhaps because they don't believe they have a sufficiently close relationship, or because they are not emotionally available themselves, or they have enough emotional burdens of their own. That's okay - not everyone can do this.

In order to choose the right people to share emotions with, you can consider these approaches:

* People who you never hear gossip from are likely to be kinder people. Choose them over people who are liable to share your inner-most thoughts carelessly.
* Start with a woman first, if you have a woman in your life who is emotionally intelligent, emotionally available, thoughtful, and patient. This advice probably stems from the existing sexisms that harm both men and women - women tend to be more emotional because they are allowed to be, and men tend to be less so because it is seen as a weakness. I don't want to reinforce these ideas, since they are themselves harmful, but they do exist and we need to recognise the world as it is.
* Open out to men selectively where you feel they are themselves not exhibiting toxic forms of masculinity. If they are boastful or verbally/physically aggressive they may not be suitable.
* Add new "trusted friends" to your circle slowly and carefully. It's best to do it cautiously to protect yourself, rather than opening up like a geyser and over-sharing in a way that causes you some hurt.
* Although this can create good emotional connections, don't think poorly of your friends who cannot do this sort of emotional work - you can connect with them for other things, as you do already.
