Is your wardrobe busting at the seams and you want to simplify but have no clue where to start? Today on the blog, I'm going to go over how you can declutter your wardrobe even if you don't know where to start. I'll also be sharing tips from one of the top minimalist living folk, [Joshua Becker](www.becomingminimalist.com) and drawing from my own experience with going through a mega wardrobe declutter.

### It's simple, but not easy - guidelines to get you started on decluttering your wardrobe

These are simple guidelines, but not easy, especially if you are new to fine tuning your wardrobe, but write them down, and keep them in mind if you really want to make changes or make your own rules and use these as a guide.

1. **Doesn't fit? Gone.** How often did I keep clothing just for when "I'm that size again?" Newsflash. Having a kid (or four in my case) changes things. And oftentimes, for good! I'm all about the comfy and roomy clothes nowadays to accomodate in between sizes.
2. **Ripped, broken zippers and not easily fixed?** _Gone._ I sometimes fix my clothes when it's easy to fix, but anything super complicated go to scraps or recycling/garbage.
3. **Colour awful on you? Gone.** This one took some time to figure out, but with some help from a friend and [google searches on skin tones/colours](https://womens-fashion.lovetoknow.com/What_Colors_Look_Good_on_Me) plus thinking about what colours I liked, I figured it out.
4. **Haven't worn in 12 months? Gone.** You can create whatever rule of thumb you want here, but for me, I find 12 months is a good rule of thumb.
5. **Too many of x items? Gone.** There was a time I had so many clothes for myself that there were quite a few items I didn't wear often enough or had another that I preferred.
6. **Out of style, trend that you no longer enjoy? Gone.** Focus on timely pieces that you have that'll stand the test of time.

When I went through this process, I kept in mind what works for me NOW as a home business owner, homeschooling mom, and purged a ton of professional clothes, to boot! You can see my summer wardrobe that I shared about it detail [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/five-steps-to-build-your-simple-summer-wardrobe/). I'm all about comfy, simple, and functional now. You can also find more tips [here](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/thin-closet/) from Joshua Becker's Becoming Minimalist website that you may find helpful. Also Courtney Carver’s book [Project 333](https://amzn.to/2ZdURKp) on developing minimalist wardrobes may be helpful too.
