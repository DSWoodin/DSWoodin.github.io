 Yup. That's the one I was going to post. Here's some additional verbiage for anyone interested:


>“You still think I’m too optimistic, don’t you?” Shallan said.

>“It’s not your fault,” Kaladin said. “I’d rather be like you. I’d rather not have lived the life I have. I would that the world was only full of people like you, Shallan Davar.”

>“People who don’t understand pain.”

>“Oh, all people understand pain,” Kaladin said. “That’s not what I’m talking about. It’s…”

>“The sorrow,” Shallan said softly, “of watching a life crumble? Of struggling to grasp it and hold on, but feeling hope become stringy sinew and blood beneath your fingers as everything collapses?”

>“Yes.”

>"The sensation -- it’s not sorrow, but something deeper -- of being broken. Of being crushed so often, and so hatefully, that emotion becomes something you can only wish for. If only you could cry, because then you’d feel something. Instead, you feel nothing. Just.. haze and smoke inside. Like you’re already dead.”

>He stopped in the chasm.

>She turned and looked at him. “The crushing guilt,” she said, “of being powerless. Of wishing they’d hurt you instead of those around you, screaming and scrambling and hating as those you love are ruined, popped like a boil. And you have to watch their joy seeping away while you can’t do anything. They break the ones you love, and not you. And you plead. Can’t you just beat me instead?”

>“Yes,” he whispered.

>Shallan nodded, holding his eyes. “Yes. It would be nice if nobody in the world knew of those things, Kaladin Stormblessed. I agree. With everything I have.”

>He saw it in her eyes. The anguish, the frustration. The terrible nothing that clawed inside and sought to smother her. She knew. It was there, inside. She had been broken.

>Then she smiled. Oh, storms. She smiled anyway.

>It was the single most beautiful thing he’d seen in his entire life.
