If you're going to talk about the recent murders in Atlanta: acknowledge that these women were sex workers. Acknowledge that they were targeted, killed, considered disposable losses in a white man's "bad day" not only because they were Asian, but because they worked in an industry that has been the punchline of "dead hooker" jokes for decades. Say it. Say that they worked in massage parlors where they provided erotic services for money. Say that their association with white men's fantasies and "unrespectable" occupation was a part of the reason he felt that his feelings were more important than their lives. Say that the fetishization and sexual domination of Asian women has been a foundational element of racism and colonization and empire-building for over a century. Say that mainstream "Asian activists" and "racial justice activists" and "leftist politicians" in the West are so concerned with respectability politics that they'd rather let a whole community of workers vanish and die and be policed out of existence than actually stand up and admit that sex workers are human too. Say that sex workers deserve to make money, have jobs, get support out loud, in public, from you. Say that sex workers deserve to live. Say that sex workers deserve to live. Say that sex workers deserve to live. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it.
