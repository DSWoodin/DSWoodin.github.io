JASP is an open-source statistics package designed to make Bayesian statistics accessible. The package is very user-friendly and is perfect for introducing students to statistics with its minimalist design and continuously updated output. You can download it for free from their [website](https://jasp-stats.org/). 

## Introduction to JASP 

I recently designed a workshop to introduce students who have only ever used SPSS to the wonder of JASP. You can access both the [guide](https://osf.io/p2hzg/) I wrote and the [data sets](https://osf.io/7x8hj/) I used for the examples on the Open Science Framework. The data sets are credited to Kevin McIntyre who made them available on the [Open Stats Lab](https://sites.trinity.edu/osl) alongside some activity sheets. 

The guide covers the following topics: 
- Entering data in JASP (to be updated with the newest release version which allows data entry)
- Creating boxplots
- Assessing parametric assumptions 
- Conducting paired samples T-Tests 
- Conducting independent samples T-Tests 
- Calculating the correlation between two variables

Feel free to use it yourself or in your teaching. If you have any feedback (positive or negative) feel free to contact me.
