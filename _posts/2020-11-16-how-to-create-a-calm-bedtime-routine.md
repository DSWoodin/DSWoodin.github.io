Do you sometimes feel like you don't know where the time went? Like life is happening to you and you just roll with it without every really thinking about it? Know what I mean? 

We felt that way not too long ago about our bedtime routine. _Bedtime was a beast here_. It was loud, not something we ever looked forward to - and dare I say dreaded? 

We've been intentionally working on simplifying our home life for a long while now, but there's always. always something to work on in a growing family. And bedtime was up next. We had to do something. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about how we created a calm bedtime routine.

Before we had the calm, our bedtime routine was more like a sprint. Now it is more like a marathon..slow and steady and consistent. 

**What did we initially do?** We talked about it. Probably extensively as it was a rough part of our day as parents. 

* Discussed the hardest parts of bedtime. Which for us was when all of the kids were together, it became a mob. A very loud, hard to stop mob. 
* Brainstormed ways to streamline. 
* Tag teamed for a while to work out the kinks. 

Now it's a well oiled tame beast that we no longer dread facing. It's predictable and calm (even with some blips here and there because kids). And once bedtime routine starts, we have to keep rolling or it'll fall apart once again. 

## Our old bedtime routine

We aimed around a certain time to start the routine, but often missed the mark, and that never helped out our situation. Everyone piled into the bathroom at the same time and it was chaos. People making loud noises and running away. Oh my. It was exhausting and not peaceful and we often didn't look forward to it. 

## Our new bedtime routine

We get everyone upstairs for bed at the same time. We call each child one at a time and only focus on them to get them ready start to finish. Quiet activities are encouraged for the others while this is happening. One at a time until everyone is ready. It takes a while, but it's been such a good, peaceful change. 

_PS if you’d like a list of other ideas of boundaries you can set around bedtime for various ages, feel free to send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _if you’d like that._
