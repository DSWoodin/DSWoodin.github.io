# Introduction

Upgrading your organization's PCs from Windows 10 to Windows 11 is an important step in maintaining a secure and modern IT environment. While this transition can seem daunting, the right combination of tools can make it a seamless process. In this blog post, we'll explore the best way to roll out a Windows 10 to Windows 11 upgrade using Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) and Intune Windows Update for Business (WuFB).

## **Benefits of Windows 11**

Before we dive into the technical details, it's essential to understand why you should consider upgrading to Windows 11. Some key benefits include:

- **Enhanced Security**: Windows 11 comes with advanced security features like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, offering better protection against modern threats.
- **Improved Productivity**: The updated user interface and productivity features streamline daily tasks and make your workforce more efficient.
- **App Compatibility**: With better app compatibility and support for Android apps, your team can access a broader range of applications.

## **The Best Way to Roll Out the Upgrade**

To ensure a smooth transition, follow these steps using ConfigMgr and Intune WuFB:

### **1. Evaluate Compatibility**

Before initiating the upgrade, assess your existing hardware and software to ensure compatibility with Windows 11. Use tools like Microsoft's PC Health Check to identify potential issues and address them in advance.

### **2. Backup and Data Migration**

Create a robust backup and data migration plan to prevent data loss during the upgrade. This is a critical step to ensure that users can quickly resume their work without data-related interruptions.

### **3. Plan Your Deployment Rings**

Divide your organization into deployment rings, starting with a small group of pilot users. This allows you to test the upgrade process and troubleshoot any issues before a full-scale rollout.

### **4. Configure ConfigMgr and Intune**

Integrate ConfigMgr and Intune to manage your upgrade. ConfigMgr handles the on-premises aspects, while Intune offers cloud-based management. Ensure that both tools are properly configured and integrated.

### **5. Define Deployment Profiles**

Create custom deployment profiles in Intune to control the upgrade process. Configure policies for feature updates, including Windows 11, and set the appropriate deferral policies to manage when updates are installed.

### **6. Monitor and Test**

Roll out the upgrade to your pilot group first. Monitor the process closely, and test all applications and workflows. Address any compatibility issues that may arise.

### **7. Gradual Rollout**

After a successful pilot, expand your deployment rings gradually. This staged approach allows you to address any unforeseen issues in smaller groups before they affect the entire organization.

### **8. Communication**

Effective communication is key. Inform your users about the upgrade process, its benefits, and any changes they might expect. Provide clear instructions for seeking help in case they encounter problems.

### **9. Post-Upgrade Support**

Continue to offer support and assistance to users after the upgrade. Address any post-upgrade issues promptly to minimize disruptions.

## **Conclusion**

A Windows 10 to Windows 11 upgrade is a significant undertaking, but with the right tools and a well-planned approach, it can be a smooth and seamless process. By using Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) for on-premises management and Intune Windows Update for Business (WuFB) for cloud-based control, you can effectively navigate the transition, ensuring the security and productivity benefits of Windows 11 are realized throughout your organization.

Remember that a successful upgrade is not just about the technical process but also about user engagement and support. By following these steps and maintaining open lines of communication, your organization can smoothly transition to Windows 11, reaping the benefits of a modern and secure operating system.
