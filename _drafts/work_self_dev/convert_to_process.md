 I love this.

I recently came across a completely unrelated quote from an engineer: Turn everything into a process, because processes can be studied, and optimized!

Reading your post just made me realize that studying a process is not only for the intent of optimizing it, it can be studied by those I hop to hire in the future to understand how the business currently operates.

A documented process is thus a matter of optimization, and delegation too!

I think you might have just saved me a shit ton of headaches in the future :D
