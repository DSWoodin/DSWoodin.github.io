"This"Â webpage is a simple collection of detailed resources and information I use for my phd work, as part of the statistics network and other research projects. I have needed an accessible location to store statistics and ecology resources for a while now and the combination of [Jekyll]("") and [GitPages]("") makes it the right time to work on it. I have always written personal notes on methods and techniques I use or recommend such as the [tidyverse]("") approach or the [UBC]("") statistics course or the [markdown]("") script I am writing this post in. Now I work in Markdown almost exclusively it means these can easily be posted as blogs or webposts.

Here is the [webpage]("https://github.com/davan690/davan690.github.io/") repository for more computer minded (open-source resources and my research), and a [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/")/[twitter]("") feed for new blog posts about statistics and ecology (not all from me).

# Current website

So far on the website I have four simple pages:

- [General statistics]("")
    - resources I use for statistics support

- [Ecological statistics]("")
    - resources I use for my PhD

- [Invasive species research]("")
    - my phd drafts

# Coming soon

- [Reproducibility]("")

- [Coding Sessions]("")

- [Bio-informatics]("")

# Contact

*Contact me* if you have any ideas or would like can contribute in any way
