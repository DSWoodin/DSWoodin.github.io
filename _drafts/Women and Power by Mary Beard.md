we need to go back to some first principles about the nature of spoken authority, about what constitutes it, and how we have learned to hear authority where we do.

And rather than push women into voice training classes to get a nice, deep, husky and entirely artificial tone, we should be thinking more about the fault-lines and fractures that underlie dominant male discourse.

How and why do the conventional definitions of ‘power’ (or for that matter of ‘knowledge’, ‘expertise’ and ‘authority’) that we carry round in our heads exclude women?

our mental, cultural template for a powerful person remains resolutely male.

the unflinching logic of their stories is that they must be disempowered and put back in their place.

it was the duty of men to save civilisation from the rule of women.

there is a radical separation – real, cultural and imaginary – between women and power.

This is the classic myth in which the dominance of the male is violently reasserted against the illegitimate power of the woman.

The fact that she is not part of the clubbable boys’ world, that she isn’t ‘one of the lads’, has sometimes helped her carve out independent territory for herself. She has gained power and freedom out of the exclusion. And she is famously allergic to ‘mansplaining’.

If that means fewer men get into the legislature, as it must do – social change always has its losers as well as its winners – I am happy to look those men in the eye.

You cannot easily fit women into a structure that is already coded as male; you have to change the structure. That means thinking about power differently.

It means decoupling it from public prestige.

more difficult for women to succeed; they get treated much more harshly if ever they mess up.
