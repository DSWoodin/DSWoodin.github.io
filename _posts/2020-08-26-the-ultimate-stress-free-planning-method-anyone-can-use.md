Today on the blog I'm sharing with you a planning method I learned through the [homeschooling world](https://readaloudrevival.com/looping-task-management-for-recovering/) that applies to anyone. Anything. Any schedule. Any kind of life.

So if you're feeling overwhelmed. If you're juggling all the things. If you constantly feel behind. Or if you just want to reduce the daily load, this method is for you!

## Introducing the loop plan

Take a circle. Inside the circle are various pieces of pie or tasks within a schedule. Essentially you have a set of tasks within a loop and loop through the tasks.

## How the loop plan works

Start with one, go through the next task. Keep going and then repeat. That's the simple explanation. In practice, you start and stop as needed. Tweaking it based on your day. Stop and start. Pick up when you need to. Stressful day? Don't do a task. Lots of extra time? Do more! It's completely flexible and adaptable.

## Ideas of where to add loop planning

- Errand running
- Housework
- Homeschooling
- Work tasks that don't need to be done daily

  _These are the areas I use too. If you'd like to dive in and start creating your own loop plan and are looking for a template, I have one for you! Send me an email at_ [_simplehomemom@gmail.com_](mailto:simplehomemom@gmail.com) _and I'd be happy to send you that._
