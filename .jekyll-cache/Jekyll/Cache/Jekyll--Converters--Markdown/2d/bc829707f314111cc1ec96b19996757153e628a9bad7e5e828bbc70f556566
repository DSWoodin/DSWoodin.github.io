<h3 id="my-story">My story</h3>

<p>My name is Easton. Iâ€™m 20 years old and Iâ€™m a junior at Marist College. I am a captain of the menâ€™s track &amp; field team. Iâ€™m from a small town in Massachusetts called Dalton. I come from a big family, with 3 sisters and a brother, along with lots of aunts, uncles, cousins, and my dadâ€™s favorite child, our dog Charli. In high school, I played basketball and soccer and continue to play intramurals here at Marist. I also love watching sports, particularly the Celtics. Iâ€™m super competitive and hold myself to a high standard in anything that I do. I am very organized and stay on top of the work that I have to do (most of the time!) I enjoy working with computers, but I also love talking to people and meeting new people. A fun fact about me is that I can solve a Rubikâ€™s Cube in under 2 minutes.</p>
