 Revising a comment I made in the fantasy artist phase of this wave:

These stories are so ubiquitous we really need to be thinking not only about the individuals but also about what encourages and enables this stuff to happen and how we an change it from the top down. Like, is there a way to have media conventions that do not create the environment for this stuff to happen?

I realize there's no institution untouched by sexual predation, but there does seem to be a particular pattern in the geek/con world.
Off the top of my head some of the issues, not all relevant to this specific instance, are:

* A culture in which men are encouraged to think of sex as the reward they are owed for success.

* Industries in which "who you know" is crucial, meaning that women simply avoiding sketchy powerful men all but requires them to settle for less success.

* The sort of rock star/hero worship exaltation of geek "heroes" in convention-land, which empowers abuse

I don't have answers but some suggestions: 

* the first agenda item on every meeting for every con from here on out is "what are we doing to ensure safety for everyone." My hope is that having that lens, that dialogue, will help narrow the opportunities for the predators

* Publishing needs to adopt some system to reduce the "who you know" factor. I realize that means profound changes and it's hard because--realistically--there's more good writers than we have time to read, let alone that publishers have the money to publish. Some amount of relationships are going to factor in, even informally--think about how much our sub promotes members of our own community! But some structures have to change for serious.
