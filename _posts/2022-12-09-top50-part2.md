Day 9 of December is almost over, so it is time to present the nine next games in the countdown... (For methodology and introduction, please see the [previous post](/2022-12-01-top50-part1/).)

### 24. The Gallerist (2015)

My third-favourite Lacerda is still such an amazing game, and also, incidentally, my favourite art-dealer themed game... It is also my favourite of his games to play solitaire. Such an easy to run and efficient virtual opponent.

| Game       | [The Gallerist](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125153/gallerist)            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Amass a fortune, and stake your reputation by operating a lucrative art gallery. |
| How        | worker placement, speculation, set collection, ...                               |
| Playtime   | 3 hours                                                                          |
| BGG Weight | 4.26                                                                             |

### 23. La Granja (2015)

This game dropped 11 places, quite possibly due to lack of plays... One of my favourite examples of multi use cards in this one.

| Game       | [La Granja](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146886/la-granja)                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Develop your farm and compete to deliver goods to the market at the right time.                 |
| How        | multi use cards, area majority, dice drafting, hand managment, simultaneous action selection... |
| Playtime   | 2 hours                                                                                         |
| BGG Weight | 3.57                                                                                            |

### 22. It's a Wonderful World (2019)

I'm quite surprised that this one dropped 7 places, since, it is just getting better every time I play it. A great game that works with all player counts -- even solo! Also, I've been enjoying the 'legacy' expansions that has been released for it...

| Game       | [It's a Wonderful World](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271324/its-wonderful-world) |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Draft yourself the ‘perfect’ dystopia, complete projects and churn out resources.        |
| How        | closed drafting, hand management, multi-use cards, ...                                   |
| Playtime   | 1 hour                                                                                   |
| BGG Weight | 2.30                                                                                     |

### 21. Lost Ruins of Arnak (2021)

Great Indiana Jones'ey theme -- updated for the more inclusive 2020's -- with great artwork, amazing components, and, the most important, solid mechanics. Worker placement, deck builder, resources, racing... Everything. And it works.

| Game       | [Lost Ruins of Arnak](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/312484/lost-ruins-arnak) |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Explore an island to find resources and discover the lost ruins of Arnak.          |
| How        | worker placement, resources, multi-use cards, deck building, race, ...             |
| Playtime   | 2 hours                                                                            |
| BGG Weight | 2.88                                                                               |

### 20. New Frontiers (2018)

The board game based on a card game based on one of my favourite board games did not disappoint. This is, for me, just a better version of Puerto Rico. It solves my main gripe with it's predecessor -- fixed turn order, by adding a new role that lets you grab the first player marker. (This is something I would like to try to "backport" to Puerto Rico at some point...) Also, it has just a better theme. (The original's slave trade theme was never great...) 

| Game       | [New Frontiers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255692/new-frontiers)           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Select an action for all that gives you the edge in building the best space empire. |
| How        | action drafting, tableau building, open drafting, race...                           |
| Playtime   | 1 1/2 hours                                                                         |
| BGG Weight | 2.90                                                                                |

### 19. Gaia Project (2017)

Gaia Project is another game that is just "better than it's predecessor". (...but I still prefer another game that is _heavily_ inspired by Terra Mystica... #spoileralert)

| Game       | [Gaia Project](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220308/gaia-project)        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What       | Expand, research, upgrade, and settle the galaxy with one of 14 alien species. |
| How        | hexagone grid, tech trees, network building, modular board ...                 |
| Playtime   | 3 hours                                                                        |
| BGG Weight | 4.39                                                                           |

### 18. Viscounts of the West Kingdom (2020)

My third-favourite West Kingdom game is a great take on rondels.

| Game       | [Viscounts of the West Kingdom](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/296151/viscounts-west-kingdom) |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Travel the Kingdom seeking upgrades in an attempt to bring poverty or prosperity.                  |
| How        | rondels, hand management, multi-use cards, deck building, area control ...                         |
| Playtime   | 2 hours                                                                                            |
| BGG Weight | 3.44                                                                                               |

### 17. Architects of the West Kingdom (2018)

Architects is another amazing West Kingdom game that really shines when you add the expansions to it -- especially _Works of Wonder_. (This takes the game from a BGG weight of a modest 2.75 to a decent 3.38...) Also, I appreciate how well it scales from 1(!) to 5 (or, apparently, to 6) players.

| Game       | [Architects of the West Kingdom](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/236457/architects-west-kingdom) |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Will you be a virtuous or nefarious servant of the king? Build your way to glory.                    |
| How        | worker placement, resources, variable player powers, open drafting ...                               |
| Playtime   | 2 hours                                                                                              |
| BGG Weight | 2.75 (or 3.38, if you want)                                                                          |

### 16. Race for the Galaxy (2007)

One of the oldest games on this top 50 is a modern classic that also sprung from the loin of good old Puerto Rico. So many interesting choices with one of the simplest takes on multi-use cards... Card as card, or card as money. Great, great stuff.

| Game       | [Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy)        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What       | Worlds await! Colonize, develop and conquer taking advantage of others' choices.    |
| How        | simultaneous action selection, hand management, multi-use cards, set collection ... |
| Playtime   | 1 hour                                                                              |
| BGG Weight | 2.99                                                                                |

## Summary

So, there you have it, 16-24, or rather 24-16, of my highly... objective... top 50 games of all time. In table form it would look something like this:
