 Start from first principles. I wish I had these resources when I was starting out:

1. [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://charlespetzold.com/code)
2. [A Crash Course in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)
3. [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course.
4. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Also, the study of data structures and algorithms is more important that learning a specific programming language. Here is a decent list of [8 Books on Algorithms and Data Structures For All Levels](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/books-about-data-structures-algorithms)

And finally, in order to expand your solution space outside of the two most common language paradigms (procedural and Object Oriented) I wish I explored these other programming language domains (When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail):

1. List based languages like Lisp or Tcl
2. Logic based languages like Prolog
3. Stack based languages like Forth
4. Functional Programming Languages like Haskell and Elm
5. Any language by Nicklaus Wirth like Modula and Pascal
6. Systems programming language that is not C or C++ like Rust, Nim, D, Zig
