 Some think that what I said was kind of harsh, but we remained cordial well after the relationship (if that means anything at all). 

What I learned from him was that being in a relationship is like working on a group project. Ideally, you want to have a partner who can take that group project, build it with you, and improve upon aspects of it you haven't considered. That way, the end result is way better than what you would have done on your own. Being with him was like working on a relationship where I was improving upon it, and he stood idly by saying that I was doing a really good job. If that's all he's doing, then I'm in no better position than doing it alone. So I told him that.  I told him that being in a relationship with him was like carrying the work load of two people while the results are exactly the same as where I would be if I were to do everything on my own. 

We ended things on that note. To be frank, I got the motivation to do the break-up from a stranger (long story) who said that my partner already knew that he was holding me back, but he was too selfish in his love for me to let me go. That break-up conversation proved her correct. There was no drama, no disagreement that he really wasn't adding value, just a heartbroken response of "I do try, but I understand." 

It really is that I felt I deserved more than someone's best efforts with mediocre results. He meant well, and I never put that on him, but we were incompatible.
