title: 2020 Genomics Workshop

In 2020 we will be offering $500-$2000 stipends for 10-20 junior research exchanges.

Applications are open for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to propose research exchanges that will expand their area of expertise or professional network beyond their field of training, under the themes of the RCN. For example, a student with a marine-focused research project may propose to visit a non-marine evolution lab. Conversely, a student studying evolutionary processes in a terrestrial system may propose to visit a marine lab.

Applicants can propose 1-2 week “networking visits.” They can propose to give a seminar, learn a skill, start a collaboration, or get critical feedback on research plan or results. (Need more specific info)

Applicants should provide a budget for their visit. If their application is approved, they will recieve a stipend for the amount requested.
