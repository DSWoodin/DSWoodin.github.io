Each one of us had a negative experience dealing with software. If you've used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram you already face some issues. Even the best software in the world has defects. The software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems which include loss of money, time, or business reputation, and the most dangerous thing which is injury or death. That's why we needed software testing.

# What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing:** is a process that consists of a set of activities and runs throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The duration usually depends on what development model is being used for the project.

In other words, Software testing is the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.

# What software testing is not?

- It's not finding every single defect.
- It's not randomly pressing buttons, hoping that something will break.
- It's not hoping that something will break, period.
- It's not something you do after all the programming is complete.
- It's really, REALLY not something you postpone until users start complaining.

# What tests will you conduct for software?

- Whether or not the software meets the requirements given by the customer?
- Does the software responds correctly to all kinds of inputs, and whether it can respond in a logical manner?
- Does the software achieve the correct results which all its stakeholders desire?
- Whether the software is sufficiently usable for end-users?
- Can the software be deployed and run in its intended environments?

# Why is software testing necessary?

In SDLC, mistakes might be done during requirement elicitation, while designing the software or while developing the code, etc. Critical mistakes can cause various types of losses and damages.To name a few reasons as to why testing is required:

- It is necessary to find and highlight the defects and errors which might have gotten into software during development.
- It is necessary to satisfy the customer’s expectations.
- If the customer is satisfied with product quality, he will gain confidence in the product and if your customer is satisfied, it is good for your business, isn’t it?
- Testing is also necessary to ensure that the software performs well; it is fast, light, and does not cause any crashes. Well-tested software provides a valuable advantage in the market.
- No developer is perfect. If you've ever written a piece of incorrect code before, then you should already see why you need to test your software.
- The Golden Rule of Testing is that you should find defects as early as you can. If you find problems with the software early on, it is often trivial for a developer to add a fix.

# Concept of Validation & Verification

Software testing also involves ensuring that the right software was created. **Verification** is ensuring that you're building the software right; **Validation** is ensuring that you're building the right software.
In other words, verification is ensuring that the system doesn't crash, that it meets the requirements, that it handles failures gracefully, etc. Validation is ensuring that the requirements meet the actual needs of the customer: Does the software do what the user wants? Are there any gaps in the requirements so that even if the software does meet all the requirements, the user will not be satisfied with the product?

Both verification and validation are part of the software testing process. Although most testers will spend much of their time concerned with verification, a software tester does not blindly test that the software meets the requirements. Testers can be thought of as defenders of the user experience, even pushing back against other internal stakeholders to develop software that meets the needs of users instead of simply meeting the bottom line.

Remember that the reason behind testing software is to **estimate** and if possible, **reduce the risk** to stakeholders. Understanding the possible risks can itself help to reduce risk. After all, untested software which was never run could be perfect, or it could not work at all. Testing helps calculate where between those two extremes the software _actually_ is. It can help us figure out whether there are issues with the software which are trivial or problems that should stop the product from shipping because major functionality does not work. By helping to determine the level of risk, software testers allow the other stakeholders involved to make appropriate decisions.\*
