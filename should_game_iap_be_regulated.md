I think for regulators who are interested in this as a topic/problem there's a couple of other lines of thought that are probably worth looking into.

**1) Toxic Side Effects** 

The _freemium_ game model overwhelmingly depends on _whales_ in order to make money/profit .  This is because, typically, most players of freemium games spend nothing so about 80-95% of revenue comes from a small fraction (~2-5%) of the player base.  This [article](https://www.recode.net/2014/2/26/11623998/a-long-tail-of-whales-half-of-mobile-games-money-comes-from-0-15) says that 50% of revenue comes from the top 0.15% of players.  

I've attended presentations where game industry insiders complained that 95% of their revenue came from a few percent of players and so they effectively had to gear development of new things in the game for the players who were actually paying, (again a small fraction) rather than all of the players. They also complained about how much effort was made to extract yet more money from the whales, which makes sense as that's where the money is. [example](https://deltadna.com/blog/mapping-evolution-whales-free-play-games/)

While anecdotes of Saudi Princes spending $30k on Farmville float around the vast majority of whales are regular people and while some surely have the means to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on games it's highly probable that others, like gambling addicts, are spending money that they don't have and are causing themselves and their families issues.  As far as I know this hasn't really been studied or looked into, but I think that it should be.

The **big problem now** is that even 'normal' full games are being converted to the freemium model. From a business perspective this allows a business to capture more revenue from a player which they would have been willing to spend in the past but didn't need to because of the fixed purchase price.  Unfortunately from a consumer perspective this also means that the price of the game goes from a fixed price to potentially thousands of dollars. (iirc ~$3800 to unlock all of EA's Starwars Battlefront 2 items)

**2) Information Asymmetry**

Gaming companies are hiring neuroscientists and people with similar skill sets to make games more addictive, or probably in the developer's minds, games more _sticky_.  It's an unfortunate sign of the times where _smart_ marketing crosses over into game development and effectively creates an addictive product. [example](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/07/24/204621796/ONLINE-REWARDS) 

This is a symptom of the broader tech field as we now hear former Facebook executives talk about:

> "The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works: no civil discourse, no co-operation, misinformation, mistruth."

But those same feedback loops are being used by game companies, especially the freemium ones.  Which, unfortunately, are has devolved into using techniques from casinos in their games with the help of neuroscientists and psychologists.

As a wannabe game dev I could see how pernicious and slippery it is because smart game design seems to boil down to short cycles of effort by the player capped off by rewarding the player, especially in a manner that offers the hope of even greater rewards soon.

This [example](https://gameanalytics.com/blog/how-to-perfect-your-games-core-loop.html) talks about how to develop games to get players into a state of _flow_, which is simply good game design. But then slot machine manufacturers have the exact same mission. [This](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games) quotes a video poker employee:

> Stretching out gameplay with minor rewards, Schüll says, "allows you to get in the flow of, another little win, another little win."

> As a result, modern slots pay out on approximately 45 percent of all spins, instead of the 3 percent of traditional slots. "The sense of risk is completely dampened," Schüll says. "Designers call them drip feed games."

3) Mainstream monetary weaponization in the gaming industry.

Initially freemium games evolved as a survival mechanism for Facebook games (Farmville) and, as phones got more powerful, games on app stores. Essentially the problem for game devs boiled down to in order to get enough people to purchase your game you had to lower the price to compete with the endless ocean of competing games.  

Relatively quickly people learned to give away the games and either display ads or let people pay to upgrade to the ad-free version. When in-game purchases started happening the developers found that they could make even more money because there was potentially no limit to how much someone could spend, vs whatever the fixed upgrade price was. Once the freemium concept was well established it then became more a execution problem as in "how do we do this more and how do we do this more effectively?" [game analytics](https://deltadna.com/blog/what-the-best-games-know-about-analytics-that-the-rest-dont/) 

The evolution of this vampiric process wasn't intentional. The gaming company executives (probably) didn't sit in their volcano lairs plotting how to exploit fundamental gaps in human cognition in order to profit wildly. 

Instead it has been a steady progression:

* buy a game, get a game

* buy a cheaper game, get a cheaper game

* buy a game, buy more of the game later

* get a free game but see ads for revenue

* get a free game but you can buy more turns, items, looks

* buy a game, optionally buy non-gameplay affecting items if you like

* buy a game, earn or buy loot boxes which give you a random chance of non-gameplay affecting items

* buy a game, earn or buy loot boxes which give you a random chance of gameplay affecting items

4) Modern analytics causes more exploitation (inadvertently or otherwise)

Even worse, with modern data and analytics we can now target users with a surgical precision while having no fundamental understanding of what we're actually doing. For example if I have a freemium game and test a new change on a subsection of players, I am probably just trying to measure what the effect is (A/B testing) and how strong that effect is. If it ultimately ends in more revenue (or longer interaction, whatever the goal was) I only know that my experiment worked. I don't necessarily know, or understand, that I've also just incrementally made my game more addictive or more seductive in the extraction of money (or time) from the player. 

But these kind of _improvements_ being good business execution are probably also leading to a Darwinian process of manipulating ourselves. Basically back to the Facebook executive's quote about unintentionally making a feedback loop that has bigger negative effects while being fantastically profitable in the near term.

In conclusion:

The primary problem, as I see it at least, is that if you're gambling you usually know that you're gambling. You walk into a casino, buy a scratch card, place a bet.  But with gaming does the average consumer of these games know that the game is employing a sort of super-evolved mechanism to stripmine as much money as possible from them, with potentially no limit at all?

Video and computer games have always been addictive, again in some way that is just fundamental to good design of an enjoyable experience. But while my grades may have suffered because of too much Diablo I didn't simultaneously go bankrupt.  As a gamer seeing the creep of paid DLC, horse armor cosmetic enhancements, and now gameplay affecting enhancements wrapped in randomized loot boxes, frankly it's disgusting.

While I understand how the industry got to where it is, I truly think that some self reflection is required. Is this who you really want to be? Is this what you really want to do?

I think one of the reasons that Indie Game devs are doing so well is because it's the last vestige of honest gaming: you buy a game, you get a game.

For regulators, I do think that loot box odds should be required to be published. I also think that loot boxes should be classified as gambling and have an age requirement, like gambling, to play games with them. I also think that ingame currencies used to purchase things ingame should either be abolished or required to show a conversion ratio to local currency. (USD or whatever)  The whole point of ingame points/money is to further disassociate users from the financial consequences of their ingame purchases. As [this](https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economics-of-microtransactions/) article notes:
> Games use these exchanges to hide the real value of what players may purchase and to make more substantial quantities seem like the “better deal.”
