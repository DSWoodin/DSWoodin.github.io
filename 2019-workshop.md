title: 2019 Synthesis Workshop
subtitle: and working groups
---

This workshop will focus on what is unique about the ocean environment as a stage for evolution and adaptation to play out. 
We will prioritize lines of inquiry that will advance knowledge in both marine science and evolutionary biology. 
In addition, we aim to reach concensus on the appropriate experimental designs and analyses for studying adaptation in marine species,
given the logistical contraints of working in marine systems.

This workshop will be held at [Shoals Marine Laboratory](https://www.shoalsmarinelaboratory.org/) from August 19-23, 2019. We aim to bring together 40-50 researchers with expertise in marine science, evolutionary biology, and oceanography, with the objective of forming 4-6 working groups who will continue synthesis activities after the workshop. Applications will open in December 2018 or January 2019. Applicants should demonstrate engagement with the network through the coordinated readings and be prepared to contribute to a working group after the workshop is over.
