### Q: What is a furry convention?
Also known as a furry con or fur con, a furry convention is a large gathering of those in the [furry fandom](https://whatarefurries.com/). At these multi-day events, those in the fandom meet up, patronize vendors, and attend smaller events called "panels".

These conventions are held in hotels or convention centers. Furry conventions usually raise money for charity (including Fur Squared).

There is no minimum level of "furriness" needed to attend. You do not need a fursuit, fursona, or interests in certain topics to attend - even those just curious about the fandom are welcome!

### Q: How can I keep up with what’s happening with the con?
