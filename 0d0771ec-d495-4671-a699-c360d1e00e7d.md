 A Gentleman In Moscow by Amor Towles.  I love it!!

I like the premise: in 1922 Russia, a Count is sentenced to hotel arrest for the rest of his life for writing an anti-Bolshevik poem four years earlier. The dialogue and prose are both wonderful, the setting is described in such a way I feel like I am there. It’s definitely what you’d call an immersive read.
