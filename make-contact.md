Things to keep in mind when contacting your MoC:

* In-person visits carry the most weight.
* Call call call! Telephone is our most important and widely used form of contact.
* Letters are good, but take an extremely long time to arrive (due to security screening).
* Email is of little help. (Not zero, but very little.)
* Petitions are no help.

Some points to remember when phoning your MoC:

* This is going to be easy ... even if you're phone phobic.
* The person who answers will be polite and non-confrontational. Their job simply is to record your opinion, where you are calling from, and pass that on to the MoC.
* Stick to regular business hours to increase the chances of getting a live person.
* If you get a busy signal try again straight away. They often clear up in seconds.
* If you get voicemail you can leave a message, but it's always better to talk to a staff person.
* Be sure you clearly express a position. Something like: "Please ask [MoC] to support/oppose [ISSUE].
* Stick to one issue. The way they log calls may get confused if you raise multiple matters.
