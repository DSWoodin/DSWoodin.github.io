 When I was in Berlin I did all the touristy things in one day. Saw the Holocaust memorial, then walked to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. I remember then going through a park and walking to the Topography of Terror, walked past some sections of the Berlin Wall and then ended up at Checkpoint Charlie. Would definitely recommend it.
