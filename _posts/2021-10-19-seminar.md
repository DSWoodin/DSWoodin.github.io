## Abstract

The sensitivity of advanced ground-based gravitational wave detectors is limited by quantum noise. In this talk, we will first review the basic quantum noise theory and its application on the detector analysis, then focus on how to use PT-symmetric quantum amplifiers for boosting the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, in particular, those for detecting the kilo-Hertz gravitational waves radiated by the neutron-star merger remnants.
