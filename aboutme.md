### my history

Prior to learning to code, I was a chemist for a company outside of Austin, TX. I learned soon that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as a chemist. So I tried to spend sometime to know what I really am made to do. The process brought me to realize my personality type is mainly INTP. From there, I picked some recommended career paths.
