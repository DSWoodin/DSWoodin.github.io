I have always worked in full-time positions so far and developed numerous successful apps. I was fortunate enough to work at studios that develop apps solely for the App Store. This experience enhanced my understanding of user experience, customer satisfaction, and the creation of high-quality apps aligned with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. I have worked on various projects and under different scales of companies with different priorities. With the knowledge gained from these professional experiences, I have also undertaken freelance projects. Here are some of the primary projects I have contributed to in recent years;
