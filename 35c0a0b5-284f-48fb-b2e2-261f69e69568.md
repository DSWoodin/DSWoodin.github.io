 I'll do a couple money and brain books:

- Your Money & Your Brain, by Jason Zweig
- The Winner's Curse, by Richard H. Thaler 

and then a few brain books that support them:

- Descartes' Error, by Antonio R. Damasio
- The Blank Slate, by Steven Pinker 
- Cheating Monkeys and Citizen Bees, by Lee Dugatkin 

All those support the idea that we have an inborn sense of economic thought, shared with other creatures(!) but that we are not at all Homo Economicus.  We are Human, and economics describe part of our nature, imperfectly.  Our decisions are human, and not always optimally financial. (edit - oops, spelling)
