  "body": "I am a paralegal at a Fortune 100 insurance company by day and a self-taught programmer by night. Oh yeah, and I also have two adorable and astute tax deductions also known as 'kids'. I have been a paralegal for 15 years, 10 of them at my current company. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications from Florida International University. I am currently enrolled at Lake Forest Graduate School of Management to complete my MBA while also working through FreeCode Camp to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. My ultimte goal is to become a Certified Scrum Master and then a Certified Scrum Product Owner. When I'm not coding or working my day job, I keep busy with my two boys, my two cats and my dog.",
