You'll probably see Event ID 9646 is logged in the application event log of your Exchange Server 2003 computer for a client opening many MAPI sessions.<br/><br/>This KB relates to the error below: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/842022">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/842022</a><br/><br/>However, i found that moving the users mailbox to another store resolved this issue without making registry changes.<br/><br/>On a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, an event that resembles the following event is logged in the Application log:<br/><br/>Event Type: Error<br/>Event Source: MSExchangeIS<br/>Event Category: General<br/>Event ID: 9646<br/>Description:<br/>Closing Mapi session "/o=<var>Organization</var>/ou=<var>Administrative Group</var>/cn=Recipients/cn=<var>Recipient</var>" because it exceeded the maximum of 32 objects of type "session".<br/><br/>When this issue occurs, you may also receive the following error message in Microsoft Office Outlook 2003:<br/><div><br/><div><br/><div>Unable to open your default e-mail folders. The Microsoft Exchange Server computer is not available. Either there are network problems or the Microsoft Exchange Server is down for maintenance.</div><br/></div><br/></div>
