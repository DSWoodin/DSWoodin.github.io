Do you have a habit that keeps slipping that you really want to instill? After reading the book [_Atomic Habits_](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, I realized that instilling new habits is way more complicated than I initially assumed. [There's a whole range of psychology involved](https://www.britannica.com/topic/habit-behaviour), for starters - our mental, spiritual, emotional health in everything that we do and how we act.

For me, I've learned I do well with visuals and trackers. And [habit stacking](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-make-habits-stick-without-much-effort/). Always habit stacking. That's actually two suggested strategies to help instill habits better in the book _Atomic Habits._ Today, I'm sharing about how to make a plan to take back your habits or instill new ones.

## How to make a plan to take back your habits or instill new ones

**_...POST INSTA IMAGE HERE (with four steps)_**

Nothing is done or completed without a good plan first for most things...so that's really the first thing to do when making a plan to take back your habits. I enjoyed the book _Atomic Habits_ as James Clear gives lots of [practical tips for creating a plan](https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide) to make habits (more likely) to stick. You also can't make a plan without knowing what to do, so I'll be sharing seven key suggestions from _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear that will help habits stick much better below:

1. **Make a plan**, as mentioned.
2. **Write it down.** [Writing things down](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2018/04/15/neuroscience-explains-why-you-need-to-write-down-your-goals-if-you-actually-want-to-achieve-them/?sh=450691297905) will help commit the plan better to memory and the habits will become not as easily forgotten.
3. **Make it obvious.** Making a habit obvious will help it to stick. An example would be to leave a glass of water in your bathroom to remind you to drink (my actual way of getting myself to drink more water ha!).
4. **Try** [**habit stacking**](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-make-habits-stick-without-much-effort/)**.** When forming new routines, stick it onto an already established habit or routine and it’ll have a more likely chance of sticking. See my blog [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-make-habits-stick-without-much-effort/) on habit stacking.
5. **Use visual cues.** This can be anything from using a [habit tracker](https://mailchi.mp/cdf3b6bae8fa/habit-tracker) to leaving your glass of water by the sink, as mentioned.
6. **Make your habit appealing.** It’s much easier to start and continue a habit if it’s intentionally made to be more appealing. I think this is where some creativity comes in play too. An example for me would be my winding down for bedtime routine. I used to really, really not enjoy my routine. I’d dread it, in fact. I used to drag my feet starting it and getting through it. Since adding in candles instead of bright, stark bathroom lights while I get ready and popping on an audiobook or podcast, this habit (routine) has become MUCH more appealing to me and it’s something I look forward to every day. I don’t often dread or skip this bedtime routine now.
7. **Start small and go from there.** I’m a big fan of starting small, but [some research](https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/researcher-recommends-taking-baby-steps-on-life-changes/) also affirms that small, consistent steps are also the way to go for most anything. The reason behind this is because most often, big steps = burnout much faster. Small steps a bit at a time tend to be more sustainable long term.

### FREE HABIT TRACKER PRINTABLE

Want to work on a new habit? Try using a [habit tracker](https://mailchi.mp/cdf3b6bae8fa/habit-tracker). It can be an effective, simple strategy to help instill new habits. You can grab that free habit tracker [HERE](https://mailchi.mp/cdf3b6bae8fa/habit-tracker).

Taking back your habits or instilling new habits can be difficult, but with a well-laid plan, it can become much easier for you to instill those new habits. I highly recommend reading through James Clear’s book on habits too. It was very insightful! You can find it in my Amazon shops under “Books that have made an impact”: [US shop](https://www.amazon.com/shop/simplehomemom) or [Canadian shop](https://www.amazon.ca/shop/simplehomemom).
