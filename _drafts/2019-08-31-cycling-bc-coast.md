With a few spare days between finishing work and starting a masters program at UBC I was keen to find some adventure. Since moving to Vancouver 1 year ago, I had been imagining some of the cycle touring trips I may do. BC's West coast holds so many potential options.

I ended up deciding on the route above. In only 3 days of riding, this route would allow to cycle on mainland Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and the Sunshine coast. Below is a summary of the route I took:

- 307 KM cycled
- 19:16 total saddle time
- 4 ferries
- 3 days and 2 nights

| Day | Start          | Finish         | Distance (KM) | Saddle Time (hr:min) | Avg. Speed (KM/Hour) |
|-----|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1   | Vancouver      | Fanny Bay      | 116.98        | 07:03                | 16.59                |
| 2   | Fanny Bay      | Dan Bosch Park | 78.73         | 04:55                | 16.01                |
| 3   | Dan Bosch Park | Vancouver      | 110.9         | 07:18                | 15.19                |



### Day 1:

Day 1 totalled 116.98 KM of cycling and 7:03 saddle time. The last time I rode over 100 KM in a day was about a year ago, so the ride was a little bit challenging. Starting in Vancouver, I crossed the Lions Bridge in West Vancouver. Biking along Marine Drive was a very scenic route filled with epic views and multi-million dollar mansions on both sides.

I arrived early at the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal with time to spare, so I grabbed coffee and breakfast at [Troll's Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/PujiheRbUhxhSNYJA)

- Day went overall very well
- One highlight, the 19A was closed, so had to detour up to the 19. This caused me to miss my target campsite. 
- Finally came to back up RV site, got there as it was getting dark. Luckily, the guy didnâ€™t want to work any more and kindly let me camp for free (light house RV park)
- Bad accident on the highway caused traffic going south to be completely backed up for miles. People were not moving at all
- It was pretty hot on the highway, lots of sunscreen
- Food: yogurt at home, eggs benny at horseshoe bay, snacks at gas station, dinner at pub (west coast food house)
- 

Day 1 route:

- Kitsilano, Vancouver to Horesehoe Bay ferry terminal.
    - I took Marine Drive instead of Highway 1.
    - Although bikes are allowed on Highway 1, and there is a big shoulder, it is a very busy highway.
    - Marine drive does have a lot of hills. But it is a very scenic ride with much less traffic. I would recommend taking this route.
- Took the ferry to Nanaimo. 
- From there, rode north in the direction of Comox (Little River Terminal).
- Camped at the [Lighthouse RV Park](https://goo.gl/maps/evKZFfgFrYVVffKSA) in Fanny Bay.


### Day 2: 

Day 2 was my shortest day. I cycled 78.73 KM with a total saddle time of 4:55. Day 2 was also probably the most enjoyable day. The ride from Fanny Bay to the Little River ferry terminal was mostly flat and I avoided the highway heat and sun by starting early.

I caught the 9:55 AM ferry to Powell River and was able to enjoy a very beautiful ferry ride across the Straight of Georgia. When I arrived at Powell River I was eager for a hearty breakfast. Just around the corner from the ferry terminal is [Base Camp Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/RaDUNZR6dXgvH1xCA). It did not disappoint! I had coffee and the Breakfast Bowl which was a mini omelette on top of a bed of greens and veggies. It was my best meal over the 3 day trip. If you find yourself in Powell River, I would highly recommend.

Day 2 route:

- Cycle from Fanny Bay to the Little River ferry terminal. 
- Took the ferry East to the Sunshine Coast (Powell River).
- Cycled south down the Sunshine Coast Highway to Saltery Bay ferry terminal.
- Took the ferry to Earl's Cove.
- Continued South down the Sunshine Coast Highway to [Dan Bosch Park](https://goo.gl/maps/xmFnQy84v7p5Unne7) on Ruby Lake where I set up camp for the night.


### Day 3

Day 3 saw me cycled 110.9 KM with 7:18 of saddle time.

Day 3 route:

- Continued from Dan Bosch Park south down the Sunshine Coast Highway to the Langdale ferry terminal.
- Took several detours along the way that were recommended to me on Reddit:
    - At [Halfmoon Bay](https://goo.gl/maps/QfHgA4q8KbVJVrbr7) took a right to stay along the coast and cycled along Redrooffs Rd. At this point the highway was starting to get a little bit busy, so it was a much welcomed break from the traffic.
    - At [Roberts Creek](https://goo.gl/maps/prrBYtEKpyaxsnjH7) took a right onto Roberts Creek Rd. which then turns into Lower Rd. This was also a much needed break from the ever increasing traffic.
- Took the ferry from Langdale back to Horseshoe Bay.
- Cycled back home to Kitsilano via Marine Drive.


### Gear

I had way more gear than required for this trip... But for me the gear is half the fun. 

![fully loaded bike]()

I had with me:

- [Surly Long Haul Trucker](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/long_haul_trucker)
- 2 waterproof rear panniers
- [Mission Workshop Transit Duffle](https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-transit-duffle-shoulder-weekender-bag) mounted to the front of my bike on a "pizza rack"
- four person tent from [MEC](https://www.mec.ca/en/)
- light sleeping bag from MEC
- sleeping pad
- 4-5 t-shirts
- 2 biking shorts
- 1 fleece sweater
- 1 light weight towel
- 4-5 socks and underwear
- 1 raincoat
- 3 spare tubes
- small multi-purpose bike tool
- small hand bike pump
- 1 handheld flashlight, 1 headlamp, 1 bike light
- bike helmet

The gear I brought worked well, but if I were to do a similar ride in the future I would make a few changes:

- This route would have been a great opportunity to replace the tent with a hammock. There were many potential hammock camping sites I saw along my route, and this would have helped reduce the load.
