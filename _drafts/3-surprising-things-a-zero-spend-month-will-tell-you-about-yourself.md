Baby steps are often forgotten about in the grand scheme of things. So often I'd sit down and think about _"Oh, I really want to do X, try this new hobby, instill this new habit, save this money"_ and never really went about it because, well, I never made a plan. But it doesn't work like that. Being good at something doesn't happen overnight for most things. Being good at something takes practice...and oftentimes baby steps will get us there.  
 Sometimes, I think it's because I only saw the END result instead of -- that first baby step.

## 3 surprising things a zero spend month will tell you about yourself

During our [zero spend months](https://myminimalistlife.com/zero-spend-month/#:\~:text=A%20zero%20spend%20month%20is,do%20spend%20your%20money%20on.&text=A%20zero%20spend%20challenge%20can,understanding%20where%20the%20money%20goes.) we've done as a family in the past, I discovered 3 surprising things, so today I'm sharing about 3 surprising things a zero spend month will tell you about yourself today.

1. **Doing a zero spend month may show you what your struggle areas are.** For us, that was 99% of the time comfort food. You know - that extra extra food on top of groceries like cheesecake (I love cheesecake) or takeout pizza ($$ it adds up).
2. **Doing a zero spend month may get you thinking about your struggles.** Oftentimes really focusing on your finances will reveal to you about the deeper issues you may (or may not!) have with finances. This could be anything from hoarding to free spending that both could have been learned about earlier in life. Discovering where your struggle areas came from and the why behind it can help you deal with what’s really going on in behind the scenes.
3. **Doing a zero spend month may lead to strong emotions.** Once you’ve discovered your struggle areas and perhaps thought about the why behind them, it may bring back strong emotions towards money. I know for me, that I have to often unpack the holding onto for dear life feelings towards money for various reasons. I found [this podcast](https://www.desiraeendres.com/withintention/2021/1/8/change-your-money-habits-get-intentional-with-your-finances-with-rachel-cruze) “[Change Your Money Habits + Get Intentional with Your Finances with Rachel Cruze](https://www.desiraeendres.com/withintention/2021/1/8/change-your-money-habits-get-intentional-with-your-finances-with-rachel-cruze)” a great, thought provoking podcast that talked about this in more detail.

**During my zero spend month in January, I once again learned our struggle areas is definitely food. We spent $80 on “extra” food. Cookies, pizza, and treats. We’re, of course, not beating ourselves up over it, but it’s good to be aware of those areas. We may also adjust our zero spend months to include one treat night of X dollars. We did pretty well this month for saving, I’d say! But, I tell you those small purchases do add up quickly if we’re not watching for them.**
