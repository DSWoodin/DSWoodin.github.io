**What's a busybox?** It's essentially a box of sensory items that a child can play with to encourage sensory play. Setting up busyboxes can encourage engaging play and also earn yourself some peace.

_From_ [_rollingprairereaders_](https://rollingprairiereaders.com/busy-box-for-kids/)_:_

> “A busy box is toy rotation on a tiny scale. Basically, you grab a shoebox or small container and fill it with a handful of open-ended toys. Your child can then mix and match the toys for a variety of play options. Unlike busy bags, where there is just *one* activity for a child to complete, a busy box allows a child to be more creative in their play. It also increases focus and stamina for playing with a limited number of materials, while building independence (and a little bit of freedom for you). A busy box can be used at any time of year, but I find my kids particularly enjoy when I “theme” them for a holiday.” 

## Why use busyboxes? 

Busy boxes can help encourage calmer days. They can be as simple and as [low cost](https://www.busybudgeter.com/cheap-dollar-store-busy-boxes/) as you make them be or as elaborate as you want. They're relatively easy to clean up, too, bearing that the sensory items stay in the box, that is.

**_Benefits of using busyboxes:_**

According to [misskindergarten](https://misskindergarten.com/busy-boxes-for-your-homeschool/), there are **three big benefits** of using busyboxes: **exploration, inspiration, and freedom.** Busyboxes can encourage children to explore the items in the boxes and in turn lead to natural learning. They can also help foster both imagination and inspiration. Watch a child during open-ended busybox play and see how inspired they become! Busyboxes allow much freedom to explore. 

### Let’s talk about how to set up a busybox in just **three quick steps!**

**Step 1: Grab a filler.**

This can be anything that fills the box, but here are several options for you to choose from:

* Beans
* Rice
* Beads
* Tapioca
* Rice
* Beans
* Lentils
* Quinoa
* Sand or Kinetic sand
* Dirt
* Water
* Plain paper

**Step 2: Grab a few accessories.**

You can use anything again here, but you’ll want to make sure it complements and expands the filler. Think dot markers for paper, a string for beads, scissors for Playdough or paper, etc. Here are some more accessory options:

* Scoops
* Crayons
* Rocks
* Sticks
* Small toys around the home (Hot Wheels, Happy Meal toys, Legos, etc.)
* Dinky cars
* Magnet or Wooden Letters

**Step 3: Place it all within a boundary**

I tend to lean toward using a bin, but a simple tray with low sides, a serving tray, or even a plate can work! This helps your child define their space for playing and working and generally makes clean up a little easier.

**Bonus:** Enjoy a little quiet! Here’s your permission to use the time to decompress, finish your chores, a cup of coffee, or give one-on-one time to another child.

_We hope you enjoy creating busy boxes for your little one. Remember - the three simple steps we outlined: filler, accessories, and a boundary.
