## Vaccination

**To attend FurSquared 2022, one of the following two situations MUST be true:**

### Option 1 - Vaccinated & Boosted

You have completed the primary vaccine series and have received a booster (bivalent or monovalent) per CDC guidelines linked here: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). The CDC considers boosters to be effective immediately, so there is no additional date restriction.

Additionally, if you are moderately or severely **immunocompromised** and **over the age of 11** the CDC recommends a **4th shot (mRNA) or 3rd shot Johnson & Johnson/Janssen** [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). FurSquared does **not** require this additional shot, but **strongly encourages** eligible attendees to do so.

&nbsp;

### Option 2 - Recently Vaccinated

You have completed an initial vaccine series by the time frame listed below. This section **only** applies if you have received your last vaccine dose **too recently** to be eligible for the booster before Fur Squared.

Proof of vaccination will be required at registration to purchase or pick up a badge.

&nbsp;

## Proof of Vaccination

**For United States residents**, we will accept:

* Physical CDC card
* Photo of CDC card
* Photocopy of CDC card
* Digital vaccine record approved by your home state which displays the following information:
  * Your Legal Name
  * Vaccine Brand
  * Vaccination Dates

Attendees that have lost their CDC card can use the below resources to locate records:

Wisconsin Residents can access WIR [https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/clientSearch.do](https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/clientSearch.do)

Illinois Residents can access Vax Verify [https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html](https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html)

Minnesota Residents can access MIIC [https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html](https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html)

Please note that we will **not** accept QR codes as proof of vaccination. You must be able to display the information listed above in plain text on your device.

**For international attendees**, please bring the document your country uses to record proof of vaccination, or a picture or copy of that document.

Any COVID-19 vaccine governmentally approved for use in your home country will be accepted.

## Masking

All attendees and staff are required to properly wear a [CDC-approved](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) face mask (a N95, KN95, surgical, or 2+ layer cloth mask made of tight knit fabric) in public spaces of the convention, including while in fursuit. CDC-approved masks are required in the Fursuit Lounges as well, even when fursuit heads are removed.

All masks must cover the wearer's nostrils and mouth snugly without excessive gaps and remain fastened in place without the use of hands or other external measures other than ear loops, Velcro, loop extenders, or buttons, etc.

Balaclavas, items made of thin & stretchy materials, and single-layer cloth masks alone are not acceptable masks, they must be combined with another type of face covering.

Masks may be temporarily removed while eating (such​​​​ as in the dining & bar area of the hotel, or at the sponsor dinner), but must put back on immediately when finished eating.

***Please note:* **Woodwind, brass, and other breath powered instruments may not be played in any convention space (other than as a scheduled performance), as masking such instruments is impractical.

## Policy Changes

In the interest of transparency, we want to advise our attendees that this policy may change in the future. Reasons for a change, if any, will be based on several factors, which may include:

* CDC recommendations
* State & County requirements
* Venue policy
* Ability of volunteer staff to enforce policy

Look to our website for the latest up-to-date information.

## FAQ

## What happens if someone refuses to wear a mask?

Refusal to comply with the masking requirement within public spaces may result in revocation of FurSquared membership for 2023, with consideration given to revocation of membership for future FurSquared events.

### Are the COVID precautions in Milwaukee the same as in my state?

Every state has differences both in law and in custom. If you are concerned about specific risks, we encourage you to check with a doctor and/or research the differences to determine if you feel comfortable attending.

### Where can I see COVID-19 statistics for Brookfield WI (Waukesha County)?

Please see the [COVID-19 Wisconsin Summary Data](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm) dashboard. Waukesha County is directly west of Milwaukee, which is in the south-east portion of the state.

### Will there be unvaccinated people outside of con space?

Yes. Please remember the rest of the hotel, elevators, hallways, restaurant, and other activities are open to the public and we can’t control who will be present. Masks are the most effective protection.

### Will there be unmasked people outside of con space?

Yes. The Sheraton Milwaukee Brookfield has ended their masking policy. The FurSquared mask policy will apply within convention space.

We encourage all attendees to wear masks outside of the convention area.

## What if somebody fakes their proof of vaccination?

Any FurSquared attendee reasonably believed to have forged vaccine status credentials will be ejected from the event and will have their membership privileges revoked for all future FurSquared events.
