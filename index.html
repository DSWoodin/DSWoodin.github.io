After nearly 15 years working in Academia (as Ph.D. researcher, Postdoc, Lecturer, and Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and Machine Learning), I decided to return to the private sector where I, previous to my academic life, worked for over 10 years. I have given many talks and presentations for various conferences and classes.

I'm the Developer Advocate at Hazelcast. I love creating content, delivering it, and hearing any feedback on my talks and presentations. Iâ€™m passionate about helping developers' communities get the most of their software tools and applications.I share my talks on my YouTube channel, feel free to subscribe or follow to get the latest of my talks, or check my GitHub for some demo ideas I use in my presentations.
