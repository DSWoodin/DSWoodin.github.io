How much time will it take?
The time you spend with the program is up to you! There are monthly meetings and numerous group events throughout the year. This includes seasonal camps in Fall, Winter, and Spring, Pumpkin Carving, Christmas Caroling, Christmas Parade, Bowling, Laser Tag, Daddy/Daughter Dance, YMCA Night, Pinewood Derby Races, and more.  You participate as your schedule allows.

 


## Program Organization
New members usually join in the fall starting in kindergarten through the sixth grade. When you join the Y Guides, you and your child are placed in a group consisting of 5-9 parents and their kids.

Members plan monthly meetings, crafts, or small group events. Members participate together at each event, creating strong friendships and a sense of acceptance.

The Y Guide Programs are organized by volunteers, working together to plan events for the entire year. Events are administered and insured by the YMCA of Central Waukesha County, but YMCA Membership is not required.
