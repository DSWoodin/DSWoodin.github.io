## Visual Life-logging through User-Centric Data Analysis [PDF](/papers/life-logging.pdf)

Life-logging represents a phenomenon whereby people can digitally record their own daily lives in varying amounts of detail, for a variety of purposes. In a sense it represents a comprehensive black box of a human's life activities and may offer the potential to mine or infer knowledge about how we live our lives. We have recently observed a convergence of technologies to foster the emergence of Life-logging as a mainstream activity. Computer storage has become significantly cheaper, and advancements in sensing technology allows for the efficient sensing of personal activities, locations and the environment. This is best seen in the growing popularity of the quantified self-movement, in which life activities are tracked using wearable sensors in the hope of better understanding human performance in a variety of tasks. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive summary of Life-logging, to cover its research history, current technologies, and applications. Thus far, most of the Life-logging research has focused predominantly on life-logging in order to capture life details of life activities, hence we maintain this focus in this review. However, we also reflect on the challenges Life-logging poses to an information retrieval scientist. This paper is a suitable reference for those seeking information retrieval scientist's perspective on Life-logging and the quantified self.
