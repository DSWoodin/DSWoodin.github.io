This post will describe how to sync a forked repo with it's parent repo. This can be applied for any branch name. We will use master as our branch to merge from the upstream repository.

## Configuring a remote fork

List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
```

If you see an upstream then continue to the next section, otherwise continue on.

Add the upstream repository to your local environment

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```

Verify that the remote repo was added

```
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
```


## Merging the remote fork

Fetch the upstream repo's changes

```
$ git fetch upstream
remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
```

Checkout your local master branch

```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

Merge the changes from the upstream to your local master

```
$ git merge upstream/master
Updating a422352..5fdff0f
Fast-forward
 README                    |    9 -------
 README.md                 |    7 ++++++
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 README
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

That's it! Now your local master branch is in sync with the upstream repo.
