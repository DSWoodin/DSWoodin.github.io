When sent through the Adobe PDF printer (or Cute PDF) as soon as it got to a worksheet with different properties is will see it as a different request and prompts for a PDF file name.<br/><br/>To resolve this issue see below.<br/><br/>1 Right click a worksheet and "select all sheets"<br/>2 Select 'Page Layout' tab and 'Print Titles'<br/>3 On the 'Page' tab select the print quality to 600 DPI and click OK<br/><br/>This will make a change on all worksheets, and if you go to file print or through Acrobat &gt; combine it will convert all
