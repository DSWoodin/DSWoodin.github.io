# Introduction
Why do I want to talk about this... Setting the scene... 

As you have probably heard in the last couple of weeks, 
actually the last two months, Russia is moving hundreds 
of thousands of military units along the border to Ukraine. 

# Assumption
Putin doesn't want to actually invade Ukraine. It's just flexing
the political muscles. Mostly driven by the west, NATO and USA especially. 


# Reasoning
Edging Putin all the time by wanting Ukraine to join EU, 
NATO isn't a very polite way. Western countries are not 
talking to Russia and poking at their borders all the time,
criticizing everything what happens in Russia. It's just 
none of our business. We all saw what can happen if the US *intervenes*.

# Conclusion
Putin isn't innocent either. But as politicians they have to push back. 
His way of pushing back is very very terrible and puts alot of people at 
actuall risk. In my opinion he isn't going to really invade and attack Ukraine, 
but if he does, it's his terrible response to all the edging and poking
done by western countries.
