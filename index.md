Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher specializing in energy systems, policy design, and techno-economic modeling.

## Research

The purpose of my work is to enable evidence-based decision making. I research sustainable energy systems, the effects of alternative policy choices, and how to design climate policy that best meets societal goals. 

My research is interdisciplinary, leveraging diverse methods matched to the problem at hand. I specialize in operations research, and integrate tools and ideas from other fields including economics, data science, and political science.

## PhD project

My PhD focuses on the impact of investor uncertainty and risk aversion on clean energy deployment, and how de-risking climate policies may accelerate decarbonization. I am developing stochastic optimization models that address these questions in the contexts of power system planning and EV charging station investments. 

Broadly, this work is motivated by the question of *how* governments could *accelerate* decarbonization. There is currently a misalignment between climate tagets and the speed of clean energy investments. The first [publication]([url](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527831425.ch8)) of my PhD shows this in the case of electric vehicles (EVs). We synthesize estimates from decarbonization pathways to understand the role EVs play in future vehicle fleets under given climate targets - finding that most vehicles must be EVs by 2050 to meet climate targets. We combine this with a fleet turnover model to explore what this means for EV sales and policy in the near term.

My ongoing work focuses on how the speed of clean energy deployment may be affected by investor uncertainty and risk aversion. In my second research project, I am modeling investments in EV charging stations and the potential for de-risking policies to speed up investments, using Real Options and Stochastic Dynamic Programming. In my third project, I am exploring how power system decarbonization is impacted by investor uncertainty and risk aversion. For this I am developing new stochastic optimization and complementarity methods.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel/groups/emesp#/view/about)), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised Members of the European Parliament and member state officials on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. My work was featured in EU Parliament and EU Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books, climbing, and cross-country skiing.
