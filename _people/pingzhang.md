# Bio

Dr. Ping Zhang is Post-doctoral researcher in the Astrophysics Center of School of Physics and Technology in Wuhan University. During hisPHD, he mainlyconcentrates on the high energy solarphysics and the high energy particle detector. The good correlation between Hard X-ray emission and high frequency radio emission during flare be known as comes from the same population of high energy electrons, interpret multi-wave observation data withits radiation process, study particle acceleration and the hightemperature plasma heating mechanism in the corona during the flare.In addition, bythe low energy relative calibration of POLAR gamma ray polarization detector on board TianGong2 with solar flare source, Dr Ping also have interest in high energy detector. In Wuhan University Astrophysics Center, Ping will continue research on the high energy solar physics radiation process by using RHESSI/In-Sight HXMT/Integral and NuStar data with Professor Wang Wei, with multi instruments observationdata (continue emission /line emission spectrum and imaging) gives a better constrain on the X-ray/Gamma-ray flare source，deduce high energy particle (mostly electrons) population and its acceleration process.
