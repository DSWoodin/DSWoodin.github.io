I am currently a Data Scientist at Facebook. Prior to joining Facebook, I completed my Economics PhD at New York University. My academic research interests were primarily focused on industrial organization, applied econometrics and behavioral economics. Outside of work, I like to code, play around with interesting datasets, climb and bike around the city.
