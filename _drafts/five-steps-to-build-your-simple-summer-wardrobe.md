Are you swimming in clothes? Or just want to get better at figuring out what to wear? This was me a handful of years back. I asked for help from a trusted friend. And booted sooo much out. Like teacher clothes I no longer needed as a stay at home mom. From there, I wanted to simplify and get better at figuring out my clothing situation. It was quite the process, but worth it now that I’m mostly out the other side. I know what I like now! Today on the blog, I’m sharing with you **five steps to build your simple summer wardrobe.** Plus you’ll get a peek at my summer wardrobe this year too. I’m so excited to share!

## So, what is a capsule wardrobe?

> _“Capsule wardrobe is a term coined by Susie Faux, the owner of a London boutique called “Wardrobe” in the 1970s. According to Faux, a capsule wardrobe is a collection of a few essential items of clothing that don’t go out of fashion, such as skirts, trousers, and coats, which can then be augmented with seasonal pieces.” (thanks, wiki)_

A neat clothing challenge to kind of get you in the mindset of having a capsule wardrobe is the Project 333 challenge! “Project 333™ is the minimalist fashion challenge that invites you to dress with 33 items or less for 3 months.” You can check out that challenge [here](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333-challenge/).

Having a smaller wardrobe, focusing on quality pieces that are classic and not [fast fashion ](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-fast-fashion)pieces will save money from replacing lower quality pieces over the years. I took time thinking about what I’d like to keep in my wardrobe and what I’d like to add over time. Instead of just buying impulse discount purchases of low quality clothes over and over to replace what didn’t make it through the last year or so.

### Five Steps to Build Your Simple Summer Wardrobe

1. **Take inventory of what you have.** Save money and time by using what you have first! Also, using what you have will also help you to figure what you actually do like wearing and what you may need in the future for your summer wardrobe.
2. **Pick your colour palette.** It’s much harder to create a simple summer wardrobe if you’re not sure what colours you’re going be using. Limit yourself to a certain amount of colours and go from there. I’m around 4 colours and a neutral currently, for reference.
3. **Pick your basics for your summer wadrobe.** Pick what kinds of basics you’d like in your wardrobe. Are you a tank wearer? V neck or scoop neck? Skirts? Shorts? What will your basics be? If you’re feeling overwhelmed, focus on less categories at first and tweak along the way.

# From my blog [“ Fifteen Basics to Consider When Building a Simple Wardrobe”:](https://www.simplehomemom.com/fifteen-basics-to-consider-when-building-a-simple-wardrobe/)

“The best way I’ve found to go about finding out what basics work best for me it is to ask myself some questions:

* What’s my lifestyle like - i.e. what is practical wardrobe wise for my life right now?
* What kinds of clothing do I like wearing?
* Can I remove some “basics” categories and simplify (such as one or two kinds of bottoms vs seven)?

For me, in one basic category for instance, that became leggings only for long pants for me eventually.”

1. **Make note of gaps.** With your current summer wardrobe, are there obvious gaps? Such as you’re down to one pair of ripped shorts? Make note!
2. **Tweak as you go and enjoy the process.**

These above steps are inspired by my [Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide](https://www.simplehomemom.com/simple-capsule-wardrobe-guide/), which walks you through simple steps to create your own capsule wardrobe that are clear and easy to follow.

_Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” Want to know more about how I fine tuned my whole wardrobe and follow along the simple steps?
