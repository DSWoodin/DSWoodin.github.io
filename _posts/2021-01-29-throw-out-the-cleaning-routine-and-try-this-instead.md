Does house cleaning stress you out and you never seem to stay on top of it?

If so, you've come to the "right place." This was me too in the past. I used to stress out if the whole house wasn't put in order by the end of the day. I'm talking about...Every dish put away or no dust bunnies hiding under my bed. And then came a point (I think it was while I was pregnant with my third boy in a row) that I hit my "breaking point" and I knew something had to change. After decluttering my home in full with [the KonMari method](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/a25846191/what-is-the-konmari-method/) (the lite version..I don't go [full folding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjkmqbJTLBM) or thanking my items that leave). I started to work on other areas of our home to simplify - like cleaning routines. Today, I'm sharing about how to throw out the cleaning routine and try this instead: a master cleaning task list. Read on to learn about how I use it.

## Going from overwhelmed to calm towards cleaning the house

_How did I get on top of my housework and reduce stress?_

* Over time, I realized and embraced the fact that I COULD NOT keep up with everything anymore.
* Over time, I realized that priorities matter more.

##### Throwing out the cleaning routine and turning to prioritizing instead.

Priorities can be applied to cleaning too, which brings me to the current method I'm using for cleaning our home. To be fair, I jump around different methods depending on what's going on with our family or season of life like [this method](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-design-a-simple-cleaning-routine/) in the past and I also tried out [the Organised mom's method](https://www.theorganisedmum.blog/tomm/), but this is working really well for me right now – which is throwing out the cleaning routine (ha)! PS - We have four kids and three adults here and full time homeschool just for reference.

## Throw Out the Cleaning Routine and Try This Instead

THE MASTER TASK CLEANING LIST. **What is the master task cleaning list?** It's exactly as described. I have a page in my [bullet journal](https://www.oprahmag.com/life/work-money/a32155559/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal/) that has all of the cleaning tasks you can think of and categorized, even things I don't think of often like cleaning the oven.

**How do I use the master task cleaning list?** I plan my days the night before for the next day usually (see my blog [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/a-simple-daily-planning-method/) on my daily planning method), and focus on top priorities - usually three in every category. Under the home category, I pick usually 3 priorities to focus on and will pull from the master task cleaning list. Sometimes I throw in a decluttering or organizing task, but for the most part it's cleaning since we just do [maintenance decluttering](https://www.simplehomemom.com/three-key-steps-to-maintaining-decluttering-sanity-with-kids/) periodically right now.

So for instance, today’s top three priorities are:

1. Vacuum the master bedroom and office.
2. Tidy the bedroom and office.
3. Make sure laundry is caught up with.

### We prioritize the daily cleaning tasks

And, that's it! We do have some daily essential cleaning like dishes and laundry, but this way we have a lot of overwhelm and simplified our cleaning routine for this season of life. It's small amounts every day, which leads to a cleaner home more consistently. Not in every area at all times, mind you, but I'm able to prioritize tasks every day and work on the priorities first.

### Try throwing out the cleaning routine and see how it feels

So maybe throwing out the cleaning routine would work for you too. It's worth a shot, right? I personally like having a few methods up my sleeve to use during those different seasons or days that require different things. So in the end? Do what works for you and your family. And maybe try throwing out the cleaning routine and try a master task list instead, using your top priorities every day. I use three, but you can do what works for you. Happy cleaning!
