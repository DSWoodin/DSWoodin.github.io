subtitle: Asking and answering the important question of why the best weapons were the best
---

When it comes to answering the question of "What's the best gun in Destiny 2 for PvP?" answering that question is fairly easy. All you need to do is head over to [Destiny Tracker's Insights page](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights) and see what the most used guns are, and those are probably the best. Answering the question of *why*, however, can be somewhat difficult, especially when there are so many weapons in Destiny 2 that there are BOUND to be near-duplicates of certain guns.
