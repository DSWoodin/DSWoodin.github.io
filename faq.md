### What does the Texas 10th Congressional District look like?

This:

This is one of those crazy gerrymandered districts that stretches from Austin and Pflugerville, through
a number of rural areas, and ending around Katy and Tomball.


### I'm not in TX-10. Is there an Indivisible group in my district?

Maybe. Check the Indivisible Austin [Congressional Districts](http://www.indivisibleaustin.com/take-action-now/congressional-districts/) page.

If one doesn't exist yet -- start it! Contact [ask@indivisibleAustin.com](mailto:ask@indivisibleAustin.com) for help.
