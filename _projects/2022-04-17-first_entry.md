Hi, this is my first post here.
 
I would love to introduce myself, but that's why I have an "About Me" section right there, in the upper right corner.
 
I still haven't completely decided which is the way i'm going to take with this website, so you might notice i have not defined yet the level of seriousness i should use, I wonder, "will i ever use this page as a personal portfolio?", and if the answer is yes, well i have to be serious somehow, but by now as we are starting, let's just flow, and see where this goes(_That's what she said_).
 
I decided to start by telling a little about how I decided to write a _"blog"_, because clearly it is something not usual, but I am really sure that most of us have thought about doing it. I mean who doesn't want to share experiences, thoughts and anecdotes? I'm pretty sure we all have a great story waiting to be told, and sometimes it is just really hard to find a way to tell it, of course, if we actually want to tell it.
 
### Story
 
I guess this goes way back, to 2017, when one of my best friends and also high-school teacher, advised me to start writing a diary, so I could unload everything that I had in my mind and it was really annoying me.<br> For a couple of months writing this diary was a great therapy, 30 minutes of my day, when I could just sit, and write about everything that was bugging my mind, without the need of actually opening up to someone, which was really hard for me at that time. <br>This "diary" i was writing, at some point it started to feel like blogging, or even writing a sitcom about myself(I consider it a sitcom because I just don't feel my life is sad enough to be considered a novel or a drama).
 
I spent like 2 or 3 years without the need of writing in this diary, but yet I kept writing when something really amazing or shocking happened to me, I really hope not to abandon this webpage like I abandoned my beautiful diary.
 
The second part of the story actually takes part a year ago approximately, I really wanted to start doing something like a Youtube Channel, or maybe Streaming, but when i thought about it, it just didn't feel like it was something that fits me, besides, thanks to my beloved University i have not much free time to do something like editing a video, or streaming for hours every day.
 
And suddenly, like 5 weeks ago, in the middle of this world wide event that was going on in my environment(Check where I live) a friend told me to read the blog of a person in our university, where this person told about how she/he was dealing with this event.<br>
When I read that blog, it just hit me! That was it, I love writing, I know that because I know how much I loved writing in my old diary, I am really interested in web-stuff, and I really wanted to find a way to open my mind to the people around me.
 
### Reflection
 
Sometimes i look like an unfriendly person, and I am not.<br>
But maybe because of many things that are hard to know about me, before someone fully knows me, it seems like I just really don't wanna be there with other people.<br>
I consider myself an open book, but sometimes it's really hard for me to open in the ways i wish.
 
Well, this is my way of saying, take, i'm opening up to all of you, in the best way I could find.
 
I will surely enjoy this, and I really hope that you will also enjoy reading me, when it's possible of course.
If you would like to share something with me, feel free to chat with me, on Instagram or any social media, or even if we both are in the same city, to have a nice talk drinking a really cheap cup of tea and eating empanadas.

_Thanks for reading, salutes from Diego._
