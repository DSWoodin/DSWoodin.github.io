1. The basics of antkeeping
1.养蚁基础知识
Before diving deeper into actual ant keeping there are some important things about ants - and about keeping pets in general - that need to be considered, otherwise the entire endeavor can go horribly wrong fairly quickly.
在深入研究实际的蚂蚁饲养之前，需要考虑一些关于蚂蚁以及一般饲养宠物的重要事项，否则整个工作很快就会出错。

1.3 Hibernation/Diapause
1.3 冬眠/滞育
In the antkeeping community, you will see this frequently being called "hibernation" although hibernation is specific to endothermic animals like birds and mammals, therefore making diapause the correct term for ants and all other invertebrates.
在饲养蚂蚁的社区中，您会看到这种情况经常被称为“冬眠”，尽管冬眠是鸟类和哺乳动物等吸热动物所特有的，因此滞育是蚂蚁和所有其他无脊椎动物的正确术语。

This is a big point, so let's get it out of the way right away. If you live in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere, some or all of your native ants may be inactive throughout certain parts of the year, just like in reptiles and amphibians. This is not exclusive to North American and European ants; Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America all have their own areas where the winter temperatures force ants to halt their activity and development until it warms up again. They must spend a few months in diapause at temperatures between 5 and 20°C (depends on the species and the area of origin) which means little to no activity, and thus nothing to observe. You may want to pay attention to the winter activity of your native ants to get an idea of the ideal number of weeks or months your local ants need to experience diapause.
这是一个大问题，所以让我们立即解决它。如果您生活在北半球或南半球的温带地区，您的部分或全部本土蚂蚁可能在一年中的某些时段不活动，就像爬行动物和两栖动物一样。这并不是北美和欧洲蚂蚁所独有的。非洲、亚洲、大洋洲和南美洲都有自己的地区，冬季气温迫使蚂蚁停止活动和发育，直到天气再次变暖。它们必须在 5 至 20°C 的温度下滞育几个月（取决于物种和原产地），这意味着几乎没有活动，因此没有什么可观察的。您可能需要关注本地蚂蚁的冬季活动，以了解本地蚂蚁需要经历滞育的理想周数或月数。

Diapause is an important part of an ant colony's life cycle and a lack of it can seriously mess up their internal clock leading to all sorts of weird behavior and will generally cause the colony to do poorly with smaller workers, smaller brood yield, less activity, less growth and possibly a queen's early death - so if you want to keep temperate ants, make sure you can provide a place for them to cool down and go through their yearly diapause. When temperatures finally warm for the first time in months, it is a significant trigger for the queen to begin laying.
滞育是蚁群生命周期的重要组成部分，缺乏滞育会严重扰乱它们的生物钟，导致各种奇怪的行为，并且通常会导致蚁群在工蚁较小、产卵量较小、活动较少的情况下表现不佳，生长速度减慢，蚁后可能会过早死亡 - 因此，如果您想饲养温带蚂蚁，请确保为它们提供冷却和度过每年滞育期的地方。当几个月来气温首次变暖时，这是蜂王开始产蛋的重要触发因素。

This period of inactivity may be boring, but it also has a few benefits like allowing you to properly clean their setup without the ants interfering – very helpful when you keep an aggressive or stinging species.
这段不活动的时期可能很无聊，但它也有一些好处，比如让你可以在没有蚂蚁干扰的情况下正确清洁它们的设置——当你饲养具有攻击性或刺痛性的物种时，这非常有帮助。

1.4 Ant food 1.4 蚂蚁食物
Like all pets ants need to eat and drink. They basically need three types of consumables: water, carbohydrates and protein.
像所有宠物一样，蚂蚁需要吃喝。他们基本上需要三种消耗品：水、碳水化合物和蛋白质。

Water 水

Most ants can store food in their social stomachs or as lipoproteins (basically fat) to survive for extended periods, so if you forget to feed them for a few days it is unlikely they will be harmed in any way. However most ants cannot survive without water for long and as such there should ALWAYS be a test tube with water in their outworld. This is especially important for ants that need a moist nest like Myrmica – the water tube is essentially a backup nest that will ensure their survival if for some reason you forget to water their nest. When you go out on a longer trip and cannot look for your ants better add a second water tube, just to be sure. Some ants (like Messor species) also use water to moisten the substrate so they can build structures, these ants can consume massive amounts of water very quickly so make sure to give them an extra load when their consumption increases.
大多数蚂蚁可以将食物储存在它们的群居胃中或作为脂蛋白（基本上是脂肪）来长时间生存，所以如果你几天忘记喂它们，它们不太可能受到任何伤害。然而，大多数蚂蚁没有水就无法生存很长时间，因此在它们的外部世界应该始终有一个装有水的试管。这对于像 Myrmica 这样需要潮湿巢穴的蚂蚁来说尤其重要——水管本质上是一个备用巢穴，如果由于某种原因你忘记给它们的巢穴浇水，它可以确保它们的生存。当您外出进行长途旅行并且无法寻找蚂蚁时，最好添加第二根水管，以确保万无一失。一些蚂蚁（如 Messor(收获蚁) 物种）也用水来润湿基质，以便它们可以建造结构，这些蚂蚁可以很快消耗大量的水，因此当它们的消耗量增加时，请确保给它们额外的负载。

Carbohydrates 碳水化合物

Most ants pick up carbohydrates in the form of sugars, like sugar water, honey, honey water, diluted maple syrup or other sweet liquids. Many ants will also happily consume fruits like apples, strawberries or passion fruit. They should have access to sweet liquids at all times.
大多数蚂蚁以糖的形式摄取碳水化合物，如糖水、蜂蜜、蜂蜜水、稀释的枫糖浆或其他甜味液体。许多蚂蚁也会高兴地吃苹果、草莓或百香果等水果。他们应该随时获得甜味液体。

There are some species that gather seeds and chew them into a paste called "ant bread". These ants are usually referred to as harvester ants (they are not a monophyletic group though) and will eat all sorts of seeds from grass seeds to sunflower seeds. They don't need sweet liquids but sometimes take them anyway, especially if the colony is still small and doesn't have larger workers to crack big seeds.
有些物种会收集种子并将其咀嚼成糊状，称为“蚂蚁面包”。这些蚂蚁通常被称为收获蚁（尽管它们不是单系群），会吃从草籽到葵花籽的各种种子。它们不需要甜的液体，但有时无论如何都应该喂给它们，特别是当蚁群仍然很小并且没有更大的工人来破碎大种子的时候。

Protein 蛋白质

Protein is what ant larvae require to build their bodies – muscles, neurons, their exoskeletons. While adult ants usually need very little protein their larvae can't get enough of it. A lack of protein food will lead to a stop of brood development, smaller larvae will be fed to larger larvae so those can finish their development to workers but after that no new ants will be born and the colony will start to slowly dwindle in numbers as the existing workers die from old age.
蛋白质是蚂蚁幼虫构建身体（肌肉、神经元和外骨骼）所需的物质。虽然成年蚂蚁通常需要很少的蛋白质，但它们的幼虫却无法获得足够的蛋白质。缺乏蛋白质食物将导致巢穴发育停止，较小的幼虫将被喂给较大的幼虫，以便这些幼虫可以完成对工蚁的发育，但之后不会有新的蚂蚁出生，蚁群的数量将开始慢慢减少，现有工人因年老而死亡。

Protein is usually consumed in the form of other arthropods like fruit flies, meat flies, green bottle flies, meal worms, crickets, locusts, roaches, small spiders and various other bugs. Some ants even eat cat or dog food and the occasional slice of ham but their main diet should still be dead insects. Generally the larger a colony is the larger the food items it can process – small colonies should only be fed with soft-skinned small (and dead) food items like fruit flies, flies, small spiders and fly larvae.
蛋白质通常以其他节肢动物的形式消耗，如果蝇、肉蝇、绿瓶蝇、粉虫、蟋蟀、蝗虫、蟑螂、小蜘蛛和各种其他昆虫。有些蚂蚁甚至吃猫粮或狗粮，偶尔也吃一片火腿，但它们的主要食物仍然是死昆虫。一般来说，群体越大，它可以处理的食物就越大——小群体只能喂软皮的小型（和死的）食物，如果蝇、苍蝇、小蜘蛛和苍蝇幼虫。

Most ants are scavengers that will happily take pre-killed or frozen food, some ants however (in particular ants of the genus Pheidole) are active predators and only really react to live food that still twitches at least. You shouldn't give live food to very small colonies though as ants might get injured or killed in the process and the ants generally rely on numbers to overwhelm living prey which obviously doesn't work if the entire colony only has twenty workers.
大多数蚂蚁都是食腐动物，很乐意接受预先杀死或冷冻的食物，但有些蚂蚁（特别是 Pheidole 属蚂蚁）是活跃的捕食者，只会对至少仍然抽搐的活食物做出真正的反应。你不应该给非常小的蚁群提供活的食物，因为蚂蚁可能会在此过程中受伤或死亡，而且蚂蚁通常依靠数量来压倒活的猎物，如果整个蚁群只有二十名工蚁，这显然是行不通的。

Harvester ants can theoretically survive without additional protein food if they are fed protein-rich plant material like nuts or almonds, but even they usually do better if given the occasional insect.
理论上，如果给收获蚁喂食坚果或杏仁等富含蛋白质的植物材料，它们无需额外的蛋白质食物也能生存，但即使是偶尔喂食昆虫，它们通常也会表现得更好。

1.5 Escape prevention 1.5 防逃逸
It is important to make sure your ants cannot just walk out of their setup and casually explore your house.
重要的是要确保你的蚂蚁不会轻易走出它们的巢穴并随意探索你的房子。

Every ant setup needs an escape barrier that ants are (supposedly) unable to cross. The most common escape preventions are either slip/powder barriers that cause the ants to simply fall off or sticky oil barriers the ants get stuck in if they try to traverse them. Having a lid also helps a lot when keeping larger ant species (lids don't work well as a barrier for very small species).
每个蚂蚁的设置都需要一个蚂蚁（据说）无法跨越的逃生屏障。最常见的逃生预防措施要么是导致蚂蚁掉落的防滑/粉末屏障，要么是蚂蚁试图穿越时被困在粘性油屏障中。当饲养较大的蚂蚁物种时，有一个盖子也有很大帮助（对于非常小的物种来说，盖子不能很好地作为屏障）。

Not everything works for every ant species so you need to do some research to find the best escape prevention for your ants. Generally it is advised to combine multiple layers of escape prevention, like a lid in combination with a slide barrier - this is even more important for those special ants that could potentially nest within your house, like many of the very adaptive species of Pheidole, Monomorium and Tapinoma or known house ants like Lasius brunneus, Camponotus pennsylvanicus and Argentine ants.
并非所有方法都适用于每种蚂蚁，因此您需要进行一些研究才能找到最适合蚂蚁的逃生预防方法。一般来说，建议结合多层防逃措施，例如将盖子与滑动屏障相结合 - 这对于那些可能在您的房屋内筑巢的特殊蚂蚁来说更为重要，例如许多适应性很强的 Pheidole、Monomorium 物种Tapinoma 或已知的家蚁，如 Lasius brunneus、Camponotus pennsylvanicus 和阿根廷蚁。

The most popular barriers in ant keeping are Fluon (liquid PTFE/teflon) and baby powder mixed with rubbing alcohol.
饲养蚂蚁时最常用的屏障是 氟利昂（液体聚四氟乙烯/聚四氟乙烯）和与外用酒精混合的婴儿爽身粉。

Slide barrier 滑动屏障

This type of escape prevention is a film that gets applied to the the upper edge of the outworld (and the frame/lid if available).
这种类型的逃逸预防是一种薄膜，应用于外部世界的上边缘（以及框架/盖子，如果有的话）。

Fluon 氟利昂
This is essentially liquid PTFE or "Teflon". It creates a slippery film that makes the ants loose grip and slide down. Fluon works especially well in dry environments where it lasts for months, sometimes years. In very humid conditions (like in the tropics) the Fluon barrier degrades much quicker and needs to be replaced every few weeks. Fluon is generally considered the most effective barrier unless your environment or your ant setup is dripping wet. There are a few rare ants that can walk over Fluon though, like Carebara minors.
这本质上是液体聚四氟乙烯或“特氟龙”。它会形成一层滑膜，使蚂蚁失去抓地力并滑落。 氟利昂在干燥环境中效果特别好，可持续数月甚至数年。在非常潮湿的条件下（例如在热带地区），氟利昂屏障降解速度更快，需要每隔几周更换一次。 氟利昂通常被认为是最有效的屏障，除非您的环境或蚂蚁设置湿透了。不过，有一些罕见的蚂蚁可以在氟利昂上行走，例如 Carebara 幼蚁。

Baby powder (mixed with rubbing alcohol)
婴儿爽身粉（与外用酒精混合）
Talkum or baby powder is a good barrier for medium-sized and large ants. It creates a dust film of small particles and when an ant tries to walk over the barrier a part of the particles detach from the surface and cause the ant to loose grip. Rubbing alcohol is often combined with talkum/baby powder to create a thick fluid mass that can be picked up with a tissue paper and easily smeared across the area where the barrier should be. The alcohol will then vaporize which results in an evenly distributed talkum barrier. Talkum barriers are not effective against very small ants, many of them can just ignore it. They also degrade with every ant trying to pass it, so large colonies that constantly challenge it will sooner or later be able to breach the barrier just by "walking it off". High humidity has a negative impact on the lifetime of a powder barrier as well so it needs to be replaced more often as in a dry environment.
Talkum 或婴儿爽身粉对于中型和大型蚂蚁来说是一个很好的屏障。它会形成一层由小颗粒组成的尘膜，当蚂蚁试图越过屏障时，部分颗粒会从表面脱落，导致蚂蚁失去抓力。外用酒精通常与爽身粉/婴儿爽身粉混合，形成浓稠的液体团，可以用薄纸沾取，并轻松涂抹在应有屏障的区域。然后酒精会蒸发，从而形成均匀分布的白话膜屏障。 Talkum 屏障对非常小的蚂蚁无效，许多蚂蚁可以忽略它。当每只蚂蚁试图通过它时，它们也会退化，因此不断挑战它的大型蚁群迟早能够通过“走开”来突破屏障。高湿度也会对粉末屏障的使用寿命产生负面影响，因此需要像在干燥环境中一样更频繁地更换。

Olive oil 橄榄油
This type of barrier works best for larger ants, smaller ants can get stuck in it and die. Some ants, particularly ones from the Formica genus, like to stick debris on it which makes the barrier ineffective. Some ants will gather at the barrier to drink the oil, this is not an issue unless they lick away the entire barrier.
这种类型的屏障最适合较大的蚂蚁，较小的蚂蚁可能会被卡在其中并死亡。有些蚂蚁，特别是福米卡属的蚂蚁，喜欢在上面粘上碎片，这使得屏障失效。有些蚂蚁会聚集在屏障处喝油，这不是问题，除非它们舔掉整个屏障。

Paraffine/Vaseline 石蜡/凡士林
This barrier only works with large ants. Smaller ants will get stuck in it and die, also several ants species can just walk over it. Some ants, particularly ones from the Formica genus, like to stick debris on it which makes the barrier ineffective.
这个屏障只对大蚂蚁有效。较小的蚂蚁会被困在里面而死，也有几种蚂蚁可以从上面走过去。有些蚂蚁，特别是福米卡属的蚂蚁，喜欢在上面粘上碎片，这使得屏障失效。

Lid 盖子

One of the best escape preventions is a good lid, especially when you are dealing with larger ants. It simply makes it physically impossible for ants to escape. Smaller ants might need special air-tight lids with rubber inlays that fit perfectly on top of their container plus a fine mesh in the center of the lid for air flow. There are certain larger ants such as Camponotus and Messor which have majors that are able to chew through fine metal grid, these may need a more durable ventilation mesh. If you are using an aquarium tank to house your ants be aware that many aquariums have walls that are slightly uneven (some walls are a bit higher than others), this may prevent a perfect fit of the lid and allow very small ants to squeeze through the gaps.
最好的逃生预防措施之一是一个好的盖子，尤其是当您面对较大的蚂蚁时。它只是让蚂蚁在物理上无法逃脱。较小的蚂蚁可能需要带有橡胶嵌体的特殊气密盖，完美贴合在容器顶部，并在盖子中心有一个细网以促进空气流通。有些较大的蚂蚁，如弓背蚁和梅索尔蚁，它们的主要特征是能够咀嚼细金属网格，这些蚂蚁可能需要更耐用的通风网。如果您使用水族箱来容纳蚂蚁，请注意许多水族箱的墙壁稍微不平坦（有些墙壁比其他墙壁高一点），这可能会妨碍盖子的完美贴合，并让非常小的蚂蚁挤进去缺口。

Frame 框架

A glass frame on top of an outworld with a slide barrier applied to it's lower side will keep all but the most stubborn ants from escaping your setup. There are quite a few ants that are able to cross vertical slide barriers but hardly any of those can walk on a slide barrier while upside-down. Some outworld designs even come with integrated frames. Some people also use the frame as the only place to apply the slide barrier because they don't like the milky film that type of barrier creates on the side walls of the outworld.
外部世界顶部的玻璃框架，其下侧装有滑动屏障，可以防止除了最顽固的蚂蚁之外的所有蚂蚁逃离您的设置。有相当多的蚂蚁能够穿过垂直的滑动障碍物，但几乎没有一只蚂蚁能够倒立地在滑动障碍物上行走。一些外星设计甚至配备了集成框架。有些人还使用框架作为应用滑动屏障的唯一位置，因为他们不喜欢这种类型的屏障在外部世界的侧壁上产生的乳白色薄膜。

Moat 护城河

Placing the ant setup within a bowl filled with water can prevent the ants from escaping. The idea is that the ants won't dare to cross the water or drown when trying. However a moat barrier requires a lot of maintenance and is far less secure than one might assume. The water can evaporate which will nullify the barrier and if the water is not changed frequently dust will gather on the surface which can increase the surface tension to a level where small ants can actually walk on the water. Some ants (Messor, certain Formica) are capable of throwing enough debris into the moat to build a bridge across it, others (Solenopsis, certain Formica species, all kinds of army ants) can build bridges with their own bodies and certain ants (Atta in particular) can just walk through the moat and emerge unharmed on the other side. A few ant species (Messor in particular) also have a particular habit of drowning in larger amounts of water. Filling the moat with oil can provide extra safety as oil doesn't evaporate as fast as water does but it will definitely kill any ant that falls into it. And even an oil barrier can be bridged by ants throwing debris into the moat. Generally a moat should only be used as an additional layer of protection for very escape-happy ants and not as a primary barrier.
将蚂蚁装置放置在装满水的碗中可以防止蚂蚁逃跑。这个想法是，蚂蚁在尝试时不敢穿过水面或被淹死。然而，护城河屏障需要大量维护，而且远没有人们想象的那么安全。水会蒸发，这将使屏障失效，如果不经常换水，灰尘会聚集在表面，这会增加表面张力，达到小蚂蚁实际上可以在水面上行走的水平。一些蚂蚁（Messor，某些福米卡蚂蚁）能够将足够的碎片扔进护城河以在护城河上建造一座桥梁，其他蚂蚁（红火蚁，某些福米卡物种，各种军蚁）可以用自己的身体和某些蚂蚁（Atta特别是）可以穿过护城河并毫发无损地出现在另一边。一些蚂蚁（尤其是 Messor）也有在大量水中淹死的特殊习惯。用油填充护城河可以提供额外的安全性，因为油的蒸发速度不如水快，但它肯定会杀死掉进其中的任何蚂蚁。即使是石油屏障也可以通过蚂蚁将碎片扔进护城河来跨越。一般来说，护城河只能用作非常喜欢逃跑的蚂蚁的额外保护层，而不是主要屏障。

1. How to start antkeeping
2. 如何开始养蚁
2.1 Starting an ant colony
2.1 建立蚁群
Starting out with a single queen is often described as "experiencing antkeeping right from the beginning" however don't get fooled by this, most ant trading pages only allow for sales of ant colonies that actually have workers and they do so for good reasons.
从单个蚁后开始通常被描述为“从一开始就体验蚂蚁饲养”，但是不要被这个愚弄，大多数蚂蚁交易页面只允许销售实际上有工蚁的蚁群，他们这样做是有充分理由的。

First of all it is impossible to prove an ant queen is mated before she actually produces her first workers – unmated queens can only produce males because haploid eggs turn into males by default and males cannot care for themselves which means the colony is doomed. A good amount of queens simply dies for unknown reasons before they get their first workers – this happens even to experienced antkeepers. The queens may be sick, infected with parasites or simply genetically defunct.
首先，不可能证明蚁后在真正产生第一批工蚁之前就已交配——未交配的蚁后只能产生雄性，因为单倍体卵默认会变成雄性，而雄性无法照顾自己，这意味着蚁群注定要灭亡。很多蚁后在获得第一批工蚁之前就因不明原因死亡——即使是经验丰富的蚂蚁饲养员也会发生这种情况。蜂后可能生病了，感染了寄生虫，或者只是基因丧失了。

Generally a colony's chances of survival exponentially increases with the number of workers it has. More ants can store more food, raise more brood, modify and moisten the nest on their own and if a few ants die due to an accident it doesn't really matter that much.
一般来说，蚁群的生存机会随着其工蚁数量的增加而呈指数级增长。更多的蚂蚁可以储存更多的食物，养育更多的幼崽，自行改造和滋润巢穴，如果有几只蚂蚁因意外而死亡，那也没什么大不了的。

Also there are three kinds of ant queens – fully claustral ones, semi-claustral ones and parasitic ones.
蚁后也分为三种——全封闭蚁后、半封闭蚁后和寄生蚁后。

Fully claustral queens  完全幽闭的女王
These queens have enough resources to raise their first workers and should not be fed unless they look really slim. The queens of these species usually never forage (there are a few exceptions like Messor queens that may assist in foraging while their colony is still small).
这些蜂后有足够的资源来养育第一批工蜂，除非它们看起来非常苗条，否则不应该被喂养。这些物种的蚁后通常从不觅食（也有一些例外，例如 Messor 蚁后，它们可能会在群体规模较小时协助觅食）。

Semi-claustral queens 半幽闭女王
These queens do not have the resources to raise their first workers and need to forage while raising their first batch of brood. These queens need to be fed with sugars and small dead insects during their founding stage.
这些蚁后没有资源来养育第一批工蚁，需要在养育第一批幼崽的同时寻找食物。这些蚁后在其形成阶段需要用糖和小昆虫尸体来喂养。

Parasitic queens 寄生皇后
These queens are incapable of caring for themselves or their brood and cannot found a colony on their own, they need workers of a host species which will raise their first batch of brood. In the wild these queens infiltrate a host colony and kill the local queen to take over the colony, however they often fail and get killed. Raising a parasitic colony is particularly difficult and often fails even when host workers are provided (without a host queen).
这些蚁后无法照顾自己或它们的后代，也无法自己建立殖民地，它们需要宿主物种的工蜂来抚养它们的第一批后代。在野外，这些蚁后渗透到宿主群体中并杀死当地蚁后以接管群体，但它们经常失败并被杀死。培养寄生群体特别困难，即使提供寄主工蚁（没有寄主蜂王），也常常失败。

If you catch a queen you need to know of which type she is which means you need to correctly identify it, a task that can prove difficult even for experienced antkeepers as some species look very similar. When buying a colony that already has workers you do not need to care for these details because after the founding stage all these types of ants behave exactly the same with the workers gathering food and raising the brood.
如果你抓住一只蚁后，你需要知道她属于哪种类型，这意味着你需要正确识别它，即使对于经验丰富的蚂蚁饲养员来说，这项任务也可能很困难，因为有些物种看起来非常相似。当购买已经有工蚁的蚁群时，您不需要关心这些细节，因为在建立阶段之后，所有这些类型的蚂蚁的行为与工蚁收集食物和养育幼崽的行为完全相同。

2.2 The basic ant setup
2.2 蚂蚁的基本设置
A basic ant setup is really cheap – it constist of just a test tube setup and a small outworld container which can be as simple as a cheap plastic box. Contrary to popular belief a starting colony does not require a separate nest.
基本的蚂蚁装置非常便宜——它仅由一个试管装置和一个外部世界的小容器组成，该容器可以像廉价的塑料盒一样简单。与普遍的看法相反，起始群体不需要单独的巢穴。

Fully claustral queens do not even need an outworld until they get their first workers, semi-claustral queens however require a small foraging are where small amounts of food can be placed (it is not recommended to feed a semi-claustral queen in her test tube as this stresses the queen and may cause her to eat the brood or abandon the tube).
完全幽闭的蜂王在获得第一批工蜂之前甚至不需要外部世界，但是半幽闭的蜂王需要一个可以放置少量食物的小型觅食区（不建议在试管中喂养半幽闭的蜂王）因为这会给蜂王带来压力，并可能导致她吃掉雏鸟或放弃试管）。

Furthermore a barrier is required that prevents the ants from escaping the outworld. Popular choices are Fluon, baby powder + rubbing alcohol or parafine – not all barriers work with every species though, so you need to do some research to find the best barrier for your species. Additional equipment like heating cables/mats, substrates (sand, sand-clay, soil) and decorations may be required depending on the species' preferences and needs.
此外，还需要一个屏障来防止蚂蚁逃离外界。流行的选择是氟利昂、婴儿爽身粉+外用酒精或石蜡——但并非所有屏障都适用于每个物种，因此您需要做一些研究来找到最适合您的物种的屏障。根据物种的喜好和需求，可能需要额外的设备，如加热电缆/垫、基质（沙子、沙土、土壤）和装饰品。

! If you have ants that are very small or multiply extremely fast you should have a plan to resettle them when they start outgrowing their first setup, otherwise you may have to resettle every ant left in the old setup individually after relocating their tube – which can be a literal pain with aggressive stinging species like Solenopsis or Pogonomyrmex.
！如果您的蚂蚁非常小或繁殖速度极快，您应该制定一个计划，当它们开始生长超出第一个设置时重新安置它们，否则您可能必须在重新安置它们的管子后单独重新安置旧设置中剩下的每只蚂蚁 - 这可能是具有攻击性的螫刺物种，如红火蚁或Pogonomyrmex，会带来真正的疼痛。

There are a few ants that don't do well in test tubes (Odontomachus trap jaw ants have a reputation in that regard and leafcutters require a special basic setup) but for the overwhelming majority of ant species a test tube setup is the best option.
有一些蚂蚁在试管中表现不佳（Odontomachus 陷阱颌蚂蚁在这方面享有盛誉，切叶蚁需要特殊的基本设置），但对于绝大多数蚂蚁物种来说，试管设置是最佳选择。

1. Ant behaviour 3. 蚂蚁行为
As antkeepers we're obviously interested in ant behaviour, so this chapter is entirely devoted to this topic. Not everything mentioned here is behavior that can be found in every ant species – some things, for example visual identification of colony members can only be found in ants with extraordinary eyesight while the typical "ant trails" cannot be observed in most primitive ants.
作为蚂蚁饲养员，我们显然对蚂蚁的行为感兴趣，因此本章完全致力于这个主题。这里提到的所有行为并非在所有蚂蚁物种中都能找到——有些行为，例如对群体成员的视觉识别，只能在视力非凡的蚂蚁身上找到，而典型的“蚂蚁踪迹”在大多数原始蚂蚁中是观察不到的。

3.1 Ant language 3.1 蚂蚁语言
Ants communicate by a surprisingly broad variety of different methods. This sub chapter will take a closer look at them.
蚂蚁的交流方式多种多样，令人惊讶。本子章节将仔细研究它们。

Chemical language 化学语言

Communication via chemicals is the most typical kind of ant language. Ants use pheromones for everything and many of the mechanisms related to their chemical language are still unknown – the fact that pheromomones are often caste-specific (they have different effects on different castes within the same colony) makes it even harder to prove the correlation of certain behavior patterns with the right pheromones.
通过化学物质进行交流是最典型的蚂蚁语言。蚂蚁将信息素用于所有事情，并且与它们的化学语言相关的许多机制仍然未知 - 事实上，信息素通常是特定于种姓的（它们对同一群体内的不同种姓有不同的影响），这使得证明信息素之间的相关性变得更加困难。某些行为模式与正确的信息素。

The most common use is identification of colony members, food items and enemies – most ants can only tell if another ant is a member of their own colony, however there are certain ponerine species that are able to actually tell apart different individuals of their colony. Pheromones are also used by workers to mark places where food can be found. Alarm pheromones indicate dangers and usually increase aggressive behavior in other colony members nearby – in some ant species they are caste-specific and trigger aggression in soldiers/major workers and flight behavior in minor workers.
最常见的用途是识别蚁群成员、食物和敌人——大多数蚂蚁只能分辨出另一只蚂蚁是否是自己蚁群的成员，但有些蚂蚁物种能够真正区分蚁群中的不同个体。工人们还使用信息素来标记可以找到食物的地方。警报信息素表明存在危险，并且通常会增加附近其他蚁群成员的攻击行为——在某些蚂蚁物种中，它们是特定种姓的，会引发士兵/主要工蚁的攻击性和次要工蚁的逃跑行为。

There's also a lot of different "infrastructure" pheromones with various feedback mechanisms – queens emit pheromones that indicate their fertility status and suppress egg-laying in workers, soldiers emit pheromones that suppress the development of more soldiers to keep the colony's caste balance in check, and workers can communicate with larvae while feeding them, telling them to grow into majors or even halt their development entirely (this is especially important for ants that hibernate with larvae).
还有许多不同的“基础设施”信息素，具有不同的反馈机制——蜂王释放的信息素表明它们的生育能力并抑制工蜂产卵，士兵释放的信息素抑制更多士兵的发育，以保持殖民地的种姓平衡。工蚁在喂养幼虫时可以与幼虫进行交流，告诉它们成长为大体，甚至完全停止发育（这对于与幼虫一起冬眠的蚂蚁来说尤其重要）。

Stridulation 鸣声

Ants can also communicate with sounds, stridulation is a special form of this. The ants rub parts of their exoskeleton together – usually thorns located on the thorax are scratched over the first gaster segment – this makes the ant look like it is spazzing out and causes them to emit a faint chirping sound that usually cannot be heard by human ears.
蚂蚁还可以通过声音进行交流，发声是其中的一种特殊形式。蚂蚁将外骨骼的各个部分摩擦在一起——通常是位于胸部的刺在第一胃节上被划伤——这使得蚂蚁看起来像是在嘶嘶作响，并导致它们发出微弱的鸣叫声，而这种声音通常是人耳无法听到的。

Drumming 击鼓

Some ants, especially the bigger ones like Camponotus and Messor species, slam their head or gaster on the ground causing vibrations that can be picked up by other ants nearby with their incredibly sensitive legs. This is often used to attract major workers or generally mark spots of interest.
一些蚂蚁，尤其是像弓背蚁和梅梭蚁这样的较大蚂蚁，会将它们的头或胃猛烈地撞击地面，从而引起振动，附近其他蚂蚁用极其敏感的腿可以接收到振动。这通常用于吸引主要工作人员或通常标记兴趣点。

Leafcutter workers vibrate when they have found high quality food – these vibrations continue to travel through the plant attracting more ants to the site. The better the food quality the stronger the ant will vibrate – this way leafcutters can quickly harvest the best parts of a plant.
当切叶工发现高质量的食物时，他们会振动——这些振动继续穿过工厂，吸引更多的蚂蚁来到该地点。食物质量越好，蚂蚁的振动就越强烈——这样切叶蚁就能快速收获植物最好的部分。

Sign language and dancing
手语和舞蹈

Most ants employ some form of sign language to pass information to each other.
大多数蚂蚁使用某种形式的手语来相互传递信息。

An ant returning home after it found food will often feed other ants a small sample of the food it found (although sometimes the actual feeding part is completely omitted) and an ant that has just been involved in a battle may make fake attack moves towards her sisters telling them in a very direct way that there is a fight ahead.
一只蚂蚁在发现食物后回家，通常会向其他蚂蚁喂食它发现的食物的一小部分（尽管有时实际喂食的部分完全被省略），而刚刚参与战斗的蚂蚁可能会假装攻击向她移动姐妹们非常直接地告诉她们，前面有一场战斗。

Many ants also engage into a variety of dance-like movement patterns similar to what bees do – a Camponotus worker can recruit other workers by doing a short "dance" in front of them and tapping them with her antennae in a certain way. The workers will then follow their leader and move as a pack. The most intricate dances are performed by weaver ants of the genus Oecephylla which can communicate the direction of food or threats and even indicate certain specific types of attackers. Ants of the genus Gigantiops which have exceptionally good eyesight perform a short dance when they encounter another worker to identify themselves as members of their species, amazingly these ants are actually able to remember individual ants they have recently met and will forgo the greeting dance in this case.
许多蚂蚁也会进行各种类似舞蹈的运动模式，类似于蜜蜂的行为——弓背蚁工蚁可以通过在其他工蚁面前跳一段简短的“舞蹈”并以某种方式用触角敲击它们来招募其他工蚁。然后，工人们会跟随他们的领导者，集体行动。最复杂的舞蹈是由织叶蚁属的织蚁表演的，它们可以传达食物或威胁的方向，甚至指示某些特定类型的攻击者。具有非常好的视力的巨型蚂蚁在遇到另一只工蚁时会跳一段简短的舞蹈来表明自己是同种的成员，令人惊讶的是，这些蚂蚁实际上能够记住它们最近遇到的个别蚂蚁，并且会放弃在这种情况下的问候舞蹈案件。

3.2 Interesting ant behavior
3.2 有趣的蚂蚁行为
Here's a few interesting things you may be able to observe in your ant colony.
您可以在蚁群中观察到以下一些有趣的事情。

Ant trails 蚂蚁踪迹

Long trails with dozens or even thousands of ants marching in a (more or less) straight line from one place to another are typical for harvester ants (Messor, Pogonomyrmex), leafcutters (Atta, Acromyrmex) and many different species that are generally called "pavement ants" in their respective country (Lasius niger, Tetramorium sp, Formica fusca, Iridomyrex sp). To observe this behavoir in captivity you need to provide them with long pieces of vinyl or plastic tubing between their different foraging areas (and probably with large outworlds as well, otherwise you'll just have mass of ants running in all directions). Ant trails are most obvious in open areas but upon closer inspection you may notice that many ants have trails in their nests as well, like highways where a constant stream of ants can quickly pass through the entire nest without having to disturb every chamber.
对于收获蚁（Messor、Pogonomyrmex）、切叶蚁（Atta、Acromyrmex）和许多通常被称为“路面蚂蚁”（Lasius niger、Tetramorium sp、Formica fusca、Iridomyrex sp）。为了观察圈养中的这种行为，你需要在它们不同的觅食区域之间提供长的乙烯基或塑料管（可能还有大的外部世界，否则你只会有大量的蚂蚁向各个方向奔跑）。蚂蚁的踪迹在空旷的地方最为明显，但仔细观察后，您可能会发现许多蚂蚁的巢穴中也有踪迹，就像高速公路一样，源源不断的蚂蚁可以快速穿过整个巢穴，而不必打扰每个房间。

Tandem running 双人跑

This is a method often employed by ants to evaluate a new nest site. A leader recruits another worker with a short dance, the recruit will then follow it's leader to the potential new nest and inspect it (sometimes though a worker just outright grabs another one and carries it to the destination), if the recruit likes the new nest it will return to the old nest together with it's former leader and become a leader by recruiting another worker. That way a large part of the colony can quickly inspect a new place and move to it if needed. Some ants that do not form foraging trails (particularly ants of the genus Camponotus) use this method to forage in small groups. A leader will recruit up to around twenty (sometimes even more) other workers which then move in a sort of stop-motion pattern to search for food or hunt as a pack.
这是蚂蚁评估新巢址时经常采用的方法。一名领队用一段短舞招募另一名工蚁，如果新兵喜欢这个新巢，那么新兵就会跟随领队前往潜在的新巢并检查它（有时工蚁会直接抓住另一个工蚁并将其带到目的地）它会和原来的领导者一起回到老巢，并通过招募新的工人成为领导者。这样，蜂群的大部分就可以快速检查新的地方，并在需要时搬到那里。一些不形成觅食踪迹的蚂蚁（特别是弓背蚁属的蚂蚁）使用这种方法以小群形式觅食。一个领导者会招募最多二十名（有时甚至更多）其他工蚁，然后它们以一种定格动画的模式移动来寻找食物或成群狩猎。

Food processing 食品加工

Feeding your ants is obviously one of the most spectacular things you can do as an antkeeper. How the ants react to food offered generally depends on the species – some ants just swarm a prey and eat it alive, others (usually the larger species) may grab it and drag it back to the nest as a whole where it gets processed, others may even burry it before they actually start eating it. While feeding live prey sure is a great thing to watch you should not do it until your colony has reached a size where they can actually deal with food that tries to escape or fight back. Many ants from small colonies will simply back off and flee when they encounter a living creature while others (Pheidole in particular) may attack it anyway and loose dozens of workers in a failed attempt to kill an oppenent that is far above their weight class, effectively crippling their colony in the process.
喂养蚂蚁显然是作为蚂蚁饲养员可以做的最壮观的事情之一。蚂蚁对食物的反应通常取决于物种 - 有些蚂蚁只是聚集猎物并将其活活吃掉，其他蚂蚁（通常是较大的物种）可能会抓住它并将其整体拖回巢穴进行处理，其他蚂蚁甚至可能在他们真正开始吃之前就把它埋起来。虽然喂活的猎物确实是一件值得一看的好事情，但在你的群体达到可以真正处理试图逃跑或反击的食物的规模之前，你不应该这样做。许多来自小蚁群的蚂蚁在遇到生物时会简单地后退并逃跑，而其他蚂蚁（尤其是 Pheidole）可能无论如何都会攻击它，并失去数十名工蚁，试图杀死远高于其体重等级的对手，但失败了，有效地在此过程中削弱了他们的殖民地。

Nest organization 巢组织

The most significant advantage of keeping ants as pets opposed to just watching wild ants is an unobstructed view into their nest (obviously this is only partially true if you keep your ants in a natural setup where they can dig into the soil). Yes, you can break up a wild ant nest (you shouldn't do that though and in some countries you can even face a hefty fee for disturbing certain ants that are protected by law such as the hill-building Formica species in central Europe) but usually all you will see is a chaotic mess with panicking ants running in all directions while trying to save the precious brood. To observe your ants you obviously have to either get them used to light – this works best with most "pavement ant" species (like Lasius niger or Iridomyrmex sp) as these ants are most adaptable, it does not work so well with nocturnal species like Camponotus barbaricus or Messor barbarus – or watch them under low-light conditions, preferably with a red light not directly focused on the ants themselves, otherwise the chaotic mess mentioned above is probably all you are going to see.
与仅仅观看野生蚂蚁相比，饲养蚂蚁作为宠物的最显着的优势是可以一览无余地看到它们的巢穴（显然，如果您将蚂蚁放在可以挖土的自然环境中，这只是部分正确）。是的，你可以破坏野生蚁巢（不过你不应该这样做，在某些国家，你甚至可能因为打扰某些受法律保护的蚂蚁而面临高额费用，例如中欧的造山蚁种）但通常你会看到一片混乱，惊慌失措的蚂蚁四散奔逃，试图拯救珍贵的幼崽。要观察你的蚂蚁，你显然必须让它们习惯光线——这对大多数“路面蚂蚁”物种（如 Lasius niger 或 Iridomyrmex sp）效果最好，因为这些蚂蚁适应性最强，但它不适用于夜间活动的物种，如Camponotus barbaricus 或 Messor barbarus - 或者在弱光条件下观察它们，最好使用红光，不要直接聚焦在蚂蚁本身上，否则您可能会看到上面提到的混乱局面。

If you use a heating cable you may notice that the ants keep all their pupae close to the heating cable (they may even use pupae or bottom substrate to "wall off" the chambers closest to the heating cable in an attempt to keep the temperate in these chambers as high as possible) while the larvae and the eggs are usually found in the colder and more humid areas of the nest. The different stages of ant brood actually have different preferences, the temperatures in which larvae grow best are a few degrees colder than those where the pupae develop the fastest. If the nest is particularly dry the ants may frequently carry brood into the water tubes and species from hot climate areas like wastelands and deserts may even bring their brood into the outworld during the night if it is warmer than the nest.
如果您使用加热电缆，您可能会注意到蚂蚁将所有蛹都靠近加热电缆（它们甚至可能使用蛹或底部基质来“隔离”最靠近加热电缆的房间，以试图将温度保持在这些房间尽可能高），而幼虫和卵通常出现在巢穴较冷和较潮湿的区域。蚂蚁幼崽的不同阶段其实有不同的偏好，幼虫生长最好的温度比蛹发育最快的温度低几度。如果巢穴特别干燥，蚂蚁可能会经常将幼崽带入水管中，而来自荒地和沙漠等炎热气候地区的物种甚至可能在夜间（如果比巢穴温暖的话）将幼崽带到外面的世界。

Although tempting you shouldn't watch your ants too often and let a few days pass before you look into their nest again – this is especially true for small colonies which can develop all sorts of unwanted behavoirs (eating brood, abandoning the nest) when disturbed too often. Also you will see much more progress if you look at their brood just once per week, ants may develop fast but even the smallest ants require at least three weeks to go from egg to worker (larger ants like Camponotus or Myrmecia may even take 3-4 months) so you're not missing anything if you don't look at them every day.
虽然很诱人，但您不应该太频繁地观察您的蚂蚁，并且要等几天后再查看它们的巢穴 - 对于小型蚁群来说尤其如此，它们在受到干扰时可能会出现各种不良行为（吃掉幼蚁，抛弃巢穴）太频繁。另外，如果你每周观察一次它们的巢穴，你会看到更多的进步，蚂蚁可能发育得很快，但即使是最小的蚂蚁也需要至少三周的时间才能从卵到工蚁（较大的蚂蚁如弓背蚁或蚁蚁可能甚至需要 3- 4 个月），所以如果您不每天查看它们，您不会错过任何东西。

4. Frequently asked questions
4. 常见问题
This is a collection of several questions frequently asked by new antkeepers. If you have a question that is not answered here just create a new topic and if it comes up often enough it will be added to the list.
这是新养蚁人经常问的几个问题的集合。如果您的问题在此处未得到解答，只需创建一个新主题，如果该主题出现得足够频繁，则会将其添加到列表中。

4.1 How large do ant colonies grow and how much space do they require?
4.1 蚁群的规模有多大以及它们需要多少空间？
This depends entirely on the species. Some ants only grow to a few hundred workers, others can grow into the millions. There are ants that grow extremely fast and ants that grow extremely slow. Colony growth rate and max colony size do not always need to match, some Camponotus species for example grow really slow during the first 2-3 years and then quickly explode into the tenthousands.
这完全取决于物种。有些蚂蚁只能长到几百只工蚁，而另一些则可以长到数百万只。有的蚂蚁生长得非常快，有的蚂蚁生长得非常慢。菌落生长速度和最大菌落大小并不总是需要匹配，例如，某些弓背蚁物种在前 2-3 年中生长非常缓慢，然后迅速激增至数万个。

Here are population numbers for some popular beginner species:
以下是一些流行的初学者物种的种群数量：

Lasius niger: up to 50.000 workers
Lasius niger：多达 50,000 名工人
Lasius flavus: up to 250.000 workers
Lasius flavus：多达 250,000 名工人
Myrmica rubra: about 20.000 workers
Myrmica rubra：约 20,000 名工人
Formica fusca: 500-2000 workers
黑蚁：500-2000名工人
Temnothorax sp: 100-300 workers
Temnothorax sp：100-300 名工人
Messor barbarus: up to 15.000 workers
Messor barbarus：最多 15,000 名工人
Ants should be kept in a stress-free enviroment, this includes a dark nest and little disturbance. Some species (Messor sp in particular) also do not like loud music (it is the vibrations that bother them, not the sound itself).
蚂蚁应该生活在一个无压力的环境中，这包括黑暗的巢穴和很少的干扰。有些物种（特别是 Messor sp）也不喜欢吵闹的音乐（困扰它们的是振动，而不是声音本身）。

! Limiting food supply is NOT a proper way to limit a colony's growth – most ant colonies will always try to grow and expand to their predefined size and all you achieve with limiting food is to encourage your ants to tackle and eventually breach your barriers.
！限制食物供应并不是限制蚁群生长的正确方法——大多数蚁群总是会尝试生长并扩大到预定的大小，而你通过限制食物所实现的只是鼓励你的蚂蚁克服并最终突破你的障碍。

4.2 How many queens should I catch and how many ant colonies should I keep as a beginner?
4.2 作为初学者，我应该捕获多少个蚁后以及保留多少个蚁群？
Usually about half a dozen queens should do. There's always a chance that some queens will die for unknown reasons, especially when the antkeeper is still inexperienced (but this happens to experienced antkeepers as well). Personally I wouldn't recommend to keep more than two colonies at the start. Ant colonies tend to grow a lot and you may find yourself running out of space quickly with five or more colonies.
通常大约六打皇后就可以了。总是有可能一些蚁后会因未知原因而死亡，特别是当蚂蚁饲养员还缺乏经验时（但这种情况也会发生在经验丰富的蚂蚁饲养员身上）。就我个人而言，我不建议一开始就保留两个以上的菌落。蚁群往往会增长很多，您可能会发现自己的空间很快就耗尽了五个或更多的蚁群。

4.3 Is it possible to keep multiple colonies in the same setup? (spoiler: usually not!)
4.3 是否可以在同一设置中保留多个菌落？ （剧透：通常不会！）
Most ant species do not tolerate competition and will immediately try to exterminate any other ant colony within their territory. This is especially true for Lasius niger, a popular beginner species in the northern hemisphere. There are some ant species that can be kept together in a setup, like the tiny Temnothorax ants can usually be combined with the huge Camponotus ants but this requires careful preparations and there is never a guarantee that it will work out in the long run.
大多数蚂蚁物种不能容忍竞争，并且会立即尝试消灭其领地内的任何其他蚁群。对于北半球流行的初学者物种黑鹬来说尤其如此。有一些蚂蚁种类可以放在一起，例如微小的Temnothorax蚂蚁通常可以与巨大的弓背蚁组合在一起，但这需要仔细的准备，并且不能保证从长远来看会成功。


Iridomyrmex sp  虹膜蝇
4.5 Can I keep my ants in the light or do they need a dark nest?
4.5 我可以把蚂蚁放在有光的地方吗？它们需要一个黑暗的巢穴吗？
Most ant species can get used to light however a dark nest is obviously the most natural. There are some nocturnal species though where keeping them in a bright environment is not recommended – in their search for a dark place they may dig into the cotton until they break through and flood the test tube and they generally will be very stressed and more likely to develop poorly.
大多数蚂蚁种类都可以适应光线，但黑暗的巢穴显然是最自然的。有一些夜间活动的物种，但不建议将它们饲养在明亮的环境中——在寻找黑暗的地方时，它们可能会挖进棉花，直到它们突破并淹没试管，它们通常会感到非常紧张，更有可能发展不好。

4.6 Can ants see red light?
4.6 蚂蚁能看到红光吗？
Yes. Ants not being able to see red light is a very common misconception that stems from studies with bees which in fact cannot see red light. Ants however are not bees and new studies revealed that ants can actually see red light very well, especially large ants with big eyes and good vision like Camponotus, Myrmecia, Ponera and Gigantiops. Subsequently red foils are no replacement for a full cover.
是的。蚂蚁看不到红光是一种非常常见的误解，这种误解源于对蜜蜂的研究，而蜜蜂实际上看不到红光。然而，蚂蚁不是蜜蜂，新的研究表明，蚂蚁实际上可以很好地看到红光，尤其是大眼睛和良好视力的大型蚂蚁，如弓背蚁、蚁蚁、波内拉蚁和巨蚁蚁。因此，红色箔片不能替代全覆盖。

Does this mean red foils are useless? No. Under low light conditions ants struggle to see red light and even if they see it they will usually react rather relaxed instead of going into full panic nest evacuation mode. When watching them through a red foil avoid bright daylight or shining directly into the nest with a flashlight, then you can most likely watch their normal nest behavior.
这是否意味着红箔没有用？不会。在弱光条件下，蚂蚁很难看到红光，即使它们看到红光，它们通常也会做出相当放松的反应，而不是进入完全恐慌的巢穴疏散模式。当通过红色箔片观察它们时，请避免明亮的日光或用手电筒直​​接照射到巢中，这样您很可能可以观察到它们正常的巢行为。

4.8 There is mold in my test tube, is it dangerous for the ants?
4.8 我的试管里有霉菌，对蚂蚁有危险吗？
Ants are far more resistent to mold that you'd think they are.
蚂蚁对霉菌的抵抗力比你想象的要强得多。

The usual "cotton turns black" mold is mostly bacterial mold that is not dangerous to ants at all. In fact the entire cotton of a test tube setup can turn black and it normally doesn't hurt the ants at all.
常见的“棉花变黑”霉菌大多是细菌霉菌，对蚂蚁来说根本没有危险。事实上，试管装置的整个棉花都会变黑，而且通常不会伤害蚂蚁。

Fungal mold is different as it's spores can potentially harm the ants. However there is no need to panic if some mold starts to grow on spoiled food – usually ants will recognize threatening spores and move to a new test tube if they have to. If fungal mold is really spreading throughout your nest try to relocate the ants to a new nest and keep it as dry as possible.
真菌霉菌不同，因为它的孢子可能会伤害蚂蚁。然而，如果一些霉菌开始在变质的食物上生长，则无需惊慌——通常蚂蚁会识别出具有威胁性的孢子，并在必要时转移到新的试管中。如果真菌霉菌确实蔓延到整个巢穴，请尝试将蚂蚁重新安置到新巢穴并尽可能保持干燥。

It is also recommendend to offer the ants some sand which they can use to cover and suppress mold growth.
还建议给蚂蚁提供一些沙子，它们可以用它们来覆盖和抑制霉菌生长。

Disturbance 骚乱

It is tempting to look at your ants every day or even multiple times per day, especially when you're new to antkeeping. This however may have a very negative effect on your ants – if they do not feel safe in their nesting space they may start eating their brood, stop laying eggs or even die early due to being constantly agitated. While your colony is still small try to limit disturbance to a minimum – you won't miss anything important if you look at your ants just once per week for a few seconds and the ants are likely to do much better when left alone most of the time.
每天甚至每天多次观察你的蚂蚁是很诱人的，尤其是当你刚开始饲养蚂蚁时。然而，这可能会对您的蚂蚁产生非常负面的影响 - 如果它们在筑巢空间中感到不安全，它们可能会开始吃掉自己的幼崽，停止产卵，甚至由于不断焦躁而提前死亡。虽然你的蚁群还很小，但尽量将干扰限制在最低限度——如果你每周只观察一次你的蚂蚁几秒钟，你就不会错过任何重要的事情，而且当大部分时间让蚂蚁独处时，蚂蚁可能会表现得更好。时间。

Humidity 湿度

This is a big one for the ants but something we humans rarely think about. Adult ants are fairly resistent to dry conditions but the brood of many species needs a moist humid environment, if it is too dry they die or workers get born with defects that render them incapable of doing their tasks. Ants of the genus Myrmica are particularly picky about this with even the adult workers drying off quickly while most species from the genuses Camponotus and Temnothorax can be kept in dry nests as even their brood does fine at room humidity. In temperate regions room humidity will always fluctuate but usually not go below 30% or above 60% (it may go up to 90% during rainy weather though), if you're living in the tropics humidity obviously will be much much higher, probably between 70 and 95%. Extensive air conditioning can lower room humidity down to 20% where even dry-resistent ants start running into problems, so if your room has air-conditioning you need to take a close eye on your ants and regularly water their nests. This is also true for tropical species kept in temperate regions – these ants are used to much higher humidity than our climate can provide and may even require technical equiment like a humidifier.
这对蚂蚁来说是一件大事，但我们人类却很少考虑。成年蚂蚁对干燥条件有相当的抵抗力，但许多物种的后代需要潮湿的环境，如果太干燥，它们就会死亡，或者工蚁天生就有缺陷，使它们无法完成任务。灰蚁属的蚂蚁对此特别挑剔，即使是成年工蚁也会很快干燥，而大多数弓背蚁属和Temnothorax属的蚂蚁都可以饲养在干燥的巢穴中，因为即使它们的幼蚁在室内湿度下也能很好地生存。在温带地区，房间湿度总是会波动，但通常不会低于 30% 或高于 60%（不过在雨天可能会达到 90%），如果您生活在热带地区，湿度显然会高得多，可能70% 到 95% 之间。广泛的空调可以将房间湿度降低至 20%，即使是耐干的蚂蚁也会开始遇到问题，因此如果您的房间有空调，您需要密切关注蚂蚁并定期给它们的巢穴浇水。对于生活在温带地区的热带物种来说也是如此——这些蚂蚁习惯的湿度远远高于我们的气候所能提供的湿度，甚至可能需要加湿器等技术设备。

Food 食物

There may be some ant colonies that eat the same food for years and years, but the truth is – most ants won't. The majority of all ant species are opportunists, in the wild they eat a lot of different things and as such are programmed to maintain a diverse diet in order to prevent malnutrition. If you feed them with the same food all the time their appetite might decline or they may outright ignore it. Try feeding them a diverse diet with lots of different items and change the primary food frequently – you could feed crickets for a week, then flies for a week, then locusts for a week and then repeat the cycle. It likely works best if you mix in an occasional piece of ham, a shrimp (a small one is enough for a young colony) or a small piece of some salt-water fish – anything salty will do (ants need salt as well, they need it in liquid form though and as most ants will simply burry salt water so giving salty food is the best option here). Many ants also eat fruits, seeds, nuts and potatoes – just make sure they're not contaminated with pesticides.
可能有一些蚁群年复一年地吃同样的食物，但事实是——大多数蚂蚁不会。大多数蚂蚁都是机会主义者，在野外它们吃很多不同的东西，因此被编程为保持多样化的饮食，以防止营养不良。如果你一直给他们喂同样的食物，他们的食欲可能会下降，或者他们可能会完全忽视它。尝试用多种不同的食物喂养它们，并经常更换主要食物——你可以喂蟋蟀一周，然后喂苍蝇一周，然后喂蝗虫一周，然后重复这个循环。如果你偶尔加入一块火腿、一只虾（对于一个年轻的群体来说，一小块就足够了）或一小块咸水鱼，效果可能会最好——任何咸的东西都可以（蚂蚁也需要盐，它们不过，需要液体形式，因为大多数蚂蚁只会埋藏盐水，所以提供咸味食物是最好的选择）。许多蚂蚁还吃水果、种子、坚果和土豆——只要确保它们没有受到农药污染即可。

4.11 My parents allow me to keep ants but they don't allow me to store dead insects in the freezer, what can I do?
4.11 我的父母允许我饲养蚂蚁，但他们不允许我将死去的昆虫存放在冰箱中，我该怎么办？
If that's your parents' only problem there is an easy solution – you can just go for a species of harvester ant (Messor, Novomessor, Veromessor, Pogonomyrmex). These ants eat seeds, nuts, almonds, fruits and even stuff like uncooked rice, noodles and bread. They will also benefit from the occasional dead insect but it's entirely sufficient to just throw in some insects you've caught inside or around your house every few days.
如果这是你父母唯一的问题，有一个简单的解决方案 - 你可以选择一种收获蚁（Messor、Novomessor、Veromessor、Pogonomyrmex）。这些蚂蚁吃种子、坚果、杏仁、水果，甚至生米、面条和面包等东西。它们也会受益于偶尔死掉的昆虫，但每隔几天把你在房子内部或周围捕获的一些昆虫扔进去就完全足够了。

You could also go for leafcutter ants but those aren't suitable for new antkeepers – the problem isn't the ants but the fungus they grow. They fungus needs very specific conditions to thrive and is rather fragile – and if the fungus dies the ants will die off soon after because the fungus is the only thing their brood can eat.
您也可以选择切叶蚁，但它们不适合新的养蚁人——问题不在于蚂蚁，而在于它们生长的真菌。它们的真菌需要非常特殊的条件才能茁壮成长，而且相当脆弱——如果真菌死亡，蚂蚁很快就会死去，因为真菌是它们的幼崽唯一可以吃的东西。
