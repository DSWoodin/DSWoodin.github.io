## Programming Schedule

This year's digital schedule is coming soon!

### Is there a fursuit parade this year?

In an effort to protect our attendees and prevent the spread of Covid-19, we will not be having a fursuit parade this year. Instead, please work with our staff photographers to arrange a photo-shoot. Further details on times and locations will be added to the schedule soon.
