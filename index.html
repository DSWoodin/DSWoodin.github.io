20+ years of experience in industry and academia in the fields of low-latency applications, IoT & Edge, distributed systems, cloud technologies, software developments, machine learning and real-time intelligent applications.

My roles varied from a Software Developer, Lead Applications Developer, IT Consultant, Research Staff and Senior Lecturer. One element that stayed constant is Public Speaking and <i>“getting the message delivered”</i>. I have given many talks and presentations for various conferences and classes.

I'm currently the Developer Advocate at Hazelcast. I love creating content, delivering it, and hearing any feedback on my talks and presentations. I’m passionate about helping developers' communities get the most out of their software tools and applications. I share my talks on my YouTube channel, feel free to subscribe or follow to get the latest of my talks, or check my GitHub for some demo ideas I use in my presentations.
