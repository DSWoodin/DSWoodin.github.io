Many little things over a period of time add up in the home. It doesn't often start out that way in my experience, but **little habits over time can add up to so much**. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about five ideas to create a simpler home. I hope the ideas are helpful!

Lately we're needing work on some routines around meal times because some days...it's a bomb over here. Oh my. Simpler isn't the word I'd call it, but hey, one thing at a time is the goal, right?

## FIVE IDEAS TO CREATE A SIMPLER HOME:

1. **Pick up as we go (as much as you can).** I'm talking about seeing something at the top of the stairs that need to go downstairs or those scrap pieces of paper on the table. If you have a minute, picking up as you go can help so much overall. It's a habit our family is working on too, a little bit at a time! Sometimes this isn't doable, though, because we have a home full of children, so we do what we can when we can. Read more about the one minute pickup rule [here](https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/how-stop-procrastinating-one-minute-rule-t161890).
2. **Focus on high traffic chores for tidying daily such as the kitchen and laundry.** These two places in the home tend to explode easily without consistent attention. Focusing on those two areas will help create a simpler home, even when the rest of the home is a bomb. That's what we do when we need to scale back for various reasons such as having a newborn or someone being sick.

3. **Meal plan.** If we don't meal plan in our home, it becomes very obvious very quickly. There's nothing like having a hangry crew waiting for their supper! ha. Even taking five minutes every week to do a loose meal plan can help so very much. Starting somewhere is better than having no plan at all, right?

4. **Write routines down.** Research shows that writing things down will help commit whatever you are writing down better to memory. Linkkkk. By writing those routines down, it's going to have a greater chance of sticking. Plus it won't be easily forgotten. _Why should we write things down?_ There are a lot of benefits to writing things down, but here are three of them:
   * Writing things down helps commit to memory better.
   * Writing things down helps us to follow through with plans better.
   * Writing things down helps us to reduce our mental load.

   [Here is a blog](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2018/04/15/neuroscience-explains-why-you-need-to-write-down-your-goals-if-you-actually-want-to-achieve-them/?sh=2c3ae6dc7905) on more benefits for writing things down.

   If you are working on a new habit, a routine, a project, new ideas or planning a vacation..really anything that is floating around your brain: **Try writing it down.**
5. **Tidy or clean something that needs it on top of regular tidying every day.** I keep track of that kind of housework by using a master task cleaning/tidying sheet. I pull from it most days and deep clean or tidy something. Read more about how I use my master cleaning task list [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/throw-out-the-cleaning-routine-and-try-this-instead/).

### My journey to creating a simpler home

About five years ago, I started my journey to simplifying. I was a stressed out, super high expectations mom, and had no solid routines or systems in place for our home. This was when I realized something needed to change. I started with decluttering and then everything snowballed from there.
