Do you feel like you're constantly tidying and cleaning? Do you feel overwhelmed by it and wish there was a better way? This was me too in the past! I was tidying up after my toddler destroyed things all the live long day. But then I had a wakeup call in realizing that it doesn't always have to be this way, this routine of constantly tidying. Today on the blog, I’m sharing about **how to develop cleaning and tidying routines in 4 simple steps**.

If you’re wanting to create a simple cleaning routine for yourself, my best piece of advice I’ve learned is that it’s more about periodically cleaning certain areas vs. having the house spotless in every area at all times. That became to me over time to be near, if not fully impossible. 

## How to develop cleaning and tidying routines in 4 simple steps

Aspects of my simple cleaning routine that you can take to create your own cleaning and tidying routines:

  
 1 loop planning - creating a set of tasks that you can loop through at your own pace.

## What’s a loop plan?

Take a circle. Inside the circle are various pieces of pie or tasks within a schedule. Essentially you have a set of tasks within a loop and loop through the tasks. You start at the beginning, move through the tasks one at a time, with no regard to the timeframe. If you miss a day, no biggie. Pick up where you left off! Read more about loop planning on my blog [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/the-ultimate-stress-free-planning-method-anyone-can-use/).

2 Setting certain tasks on a day.

We have certain things we do on Saturdays, for instance. Weekly blitz tidying on Fridays as well as tidying and clean upstairs Saturday afternoons.

3 involving the kids - what can you include them in for your cleaning and tidying routines?

Check my blog on chores and involving children [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-use-strengths-to-assign-family-chores/).

4 setting your non-negotiable bare minimum daily tasks. Ours are 100% doing something with the laundry and the kitchen (or just the dishes).  
   
Your simple cleaning routine is going to look different from mine, but hopefully these 4 steps will help you out.

As amazing as the 4 simple steps are above, it’s always good to keep in mind too that we are not robots. _We can’t keep up with all things at all times_, cleaning and tidying included.

Having a family means that there is always cleaning and tidying to be done. No kidding, right? I think I was at the number of two kids that I felt stressed out by the house. I remember a good friend of mine laughing, telling me it’ll eventually come crashing down (or something like that). She was right. I’m at four kids now and I’ve finally realized that nope. I cannot (and will not) stay on top of all things in the house. Unless I wanted to make that my life’s work. And I have other things that are life giving to me than that.
