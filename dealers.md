Vendors get ready!

We’re looking forward to another exciting year for Fur Squared and another year of exciting offerings in our Dealer’s Den!

Big things are coming to Fur Squared! This year, in addition to the regular Dealer’s Den, we will also be taking applications to our brand new after dark dealer’s den, the NIGHT MARKET!! This will be an 18+ adult only space for our dealers to take advantage of. This will be by application only, and will have a daily set-up/nightly take-down.

If you sell mostly or solely NSFW/18+ type art or merchandise, please click here for more information and the Dealer application for the Night Market: (link to “Night Market” web page).

Thank you once again for making the Dealer’s Den an amazing part of Fur Squared.

To vend in the state of Wisconsin, you are required to have a valid Wisconsin Tax ID. If you do not have one already, you can get one ([here](https://tap.revenue.wi.gov/mta/_/#0)), and click Register A Business to start.

Click the “Dealer Application” link below to apply to be a vendor in Fur Squared’s Dealer’s Den. You will need your personal information as well as links to your website/social media in order to show us your wares.

Please note that the Dealer’s Den Table (or tables) is/are purchased SEPARATELY from convention attendance. The cost of a Dealer’s Den table at Fur Squared 2023 is $75. We have extremely limited two-table spots. Two-table booths will be considered but single-table booths will be prioritized so that we can get as many vendors as possible in our limited Dealer’s Den space. Please note in the application if you can work within a consolidated space.

Important note for Returning Dealers: Because we have a sizable volume of “Regulars”, Dealers who sell at Fur Squared every year, we have decided to implement a 4-on/1-off system to allow new Dealers a larger opportunity to sell at Fur Squared. Basically, for every four years in a row that you sell at Fur Squared, you will be given one year off, so that we have more spaces available to new Dealers. That said, we will be using a random draw to determine when your “1-off” year is because many of you have already been selling at Fur Squared for over four years and we don’t want to have all of you sit out the same year. We love having all of our Dealers, but because Dealer space is so limited we wanted to create more opportunities for more people to sell in Fur Squared’s Dealer’s Den.  ((NOTE TO WEBTEAM: INDENT THIS PARAGRAPH ON BOTH SIDES))
