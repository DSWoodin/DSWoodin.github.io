## Abstract

The baryon asymmetry in the universe and the nature of dark matter remain puzzling problems despite the fact
that their abundances have been measured very precisely. Baryon asymmetry generation during a first order
electroweak phase transition is a very popular mechanism, and at the same time is associated with the
production of a stochastic background of gravitational waves, which provides a new method of probing the Higgs
potential, in complementarity to direct measurements at the colliders. The remaining majority of matter is dark,
in the sense that it interacts only gravitationally or very weakly with the standard model particles. Since its
nature remains elusive, many species have been proposed and are being actively searched for, such as the weakly
interacting massive particles, the ultralight wave-like dark matter, primordial black holes and more exotically
the boson stars. In this talk I will discuss the various ways that gravitational waves can be used in probing
the Higgs potential and in searching for the various species of dark matter, to demonstrate the power in a
nutshell gravitational waves can play in understanding our universe.

## Bio

Guo Huaike is currently focusing on issues concerning dark matter, matter antimatter asymmetry, and new physics beyond the standard model in particle physics. Specifically, he employs gravitational waves
as a new tool to explore the above problems, such as the theoretical study of gravitational waves in the process of cosmic phase transition and the experimental search on the LIGO detector, and the new physics on the collider, searching for complementary studies, and using gravitational wave detectors to explore various types of dark matter.
