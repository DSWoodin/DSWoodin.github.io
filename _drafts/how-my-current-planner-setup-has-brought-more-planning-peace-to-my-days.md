I’ve tried lots of different planning systems and setups, but right now this is my “planning peace” – a term planning folk often use when they’ve found peace with the best system setup for them. I do tweak things over time and try different things, but this is what’s working for me right now. Today on the blog, I’m sharing with you how my current planner setup has brought more planning peace to my days.

**But first. Here’s what my planner setup looks like right now…**

I use a book called a [traveller’s notebook](https://amzn.to/2Qcxqfq) and I use a planning method called the bullet journaling method. A traveler’s notebook is a cover with elastics. Each elastic loops around the inserts on the inside, creating three different sections. I could use just two [inserts](https://amzn.to/2Qcxqfq) or maybe a couple more if I needed too. I love the flexibility in this system!

Inside my traveller’s notebook, I have three inserts. I use [these ones](https://amzn.to/32bmqo3). Grid inserts are my preferred kind.

In the first insert, here’s what you’ll find:

In the second insert, here’s what you’ll find:

![A picture of my second insert and what's inside: routines, lists, charts, and trackers.](/uploads/img_20200907_132500524_compress97.jpg "journalinsert2")

And in the third insert, here’s what you’ll find:

![A picture of my third insert and what's in it: notes that I want to keep.](/uploads/img_20200907_132506497_compress65.jpg "journalinsert3")

Each insert has a specific purpose and I love that.

## How has my current planner setup has brought more planning peace to my days?

Unlike a one book method, separating my planner into three separate inserts has helped me to be better focused when I’m in each section of my book. It has become much easier to find things in my planner, especially in the second and third insert for notes and lists and routines. It’s much easier for me to plan my day because I’m only working from one insert. Everything is in one insert.  
 

**Further reading?** I enjoyed the book [Eat that Frog](https://amzn.to/2DmKOdX) for planning and procrastination tips as well as the [Bullet Journal Method](https://amzn.to/3fB51uF) for simple planning (the method I use within my current planner setup in this blog).
