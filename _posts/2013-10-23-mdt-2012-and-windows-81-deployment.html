<strong><span id="ms-rterangecursor-start"></span>MDT 2012 and Windows 8.1 
deployment</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong><br />
<br />
So when you attempt to create a Catlog file for Windows 8.1 it fails with the 
following message "Windows SIM was unable to generate a catalog. For 
troubleshooting assistance, see the topic: 'Windows System Image Manager 
Technical Reference' in the Windows ADK User's Guide."<br />
<br />
The log that pops up starts with:<br />
<br />
<strong>This application requires version 6.2.9200.16384 of the Windows 
ADK.</strong><br />
<strong>Install this version to correct the 
problem</strong><br />
<strong>Windows SIM was unable to generate a catalog. For 
troubleshooting assistance, see the topic: 'Windows System Image Manager 
Technical Reference' in the Windows ADK User's Guide.</strong><br />
<br />
Even though version 6.2.9200.16384 of the Windows ADK is installed when you 
attempt to Generate a Catalog File the issue is there is a new version of ADK 
version 6.3.9600.16411 located here <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=39982">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=39982</a><br />
<br />
<span id="ms-rterangecursor-start"></span>Once you have updated ADK you will 
need to update MDT to 2013 here <span id="ms-rterangepaste-start"></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40796">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40796<span id="ms-rterangecursor-end"></span></a><span id="ms-rterangepaste-end"></span><br />
<br />
The above will also be the root cause of a Failure deployment summary as 
below:<br />
FAILURE (5627)<br />
Failed to run the action; Install Operating 
System.<br />
Unknown Error (Error: 000015FB; Source: Unknown)<br />
<br />
A useful command to run from an Administrator command prompt is "<span id="ms-rterangepaste-start"></span>dism /cleanup-wim".  This will remove any stale 
mount points that could be causing a conflict.<span id="ms-rterangecursor-end"></span>
