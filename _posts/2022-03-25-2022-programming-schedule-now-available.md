This year's digital schedule is now available [here](https://fursquared.zohobackstage.com/2022){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\!

We encourage you to make an optional free Zoho account to bookmark events you'd like to attend, and **download a custom itinerary for offline access**. Additionally, attendees with smartphones may wish to download the free "Zoho Backstage for Attendees" app from their app store of choice.

Note that our event will not initially appear in the app's search results when downloaded. **To access our schedule via the Zoho Backstage app**, first download the app on your smart device then click the link to the schedule at the top of this post. The schedule should then open in the Zoho Backstage app, and be available for the remainder of the event.

Operating hours for convention departments (Operations, Registration, Artists' Alley, Dealers' Den, etc.) will be added as they are finalized.

We look forward to seeing you all in a few weeks at Fur Squared 2022 - CONspiracy\!

### Fursuit Parade Addendum

We've received a lot of questions about the fursuit parade missing from the schedule. In an effort to protect our attendees and prevent the spread of Covid-19, we will unfortunately not be having a fursuit parade this year. Instead, we will be having an expanded series of fursuit photoshoots with our staff photographers\! Further details on times and locations will be added to the schedule soon.
