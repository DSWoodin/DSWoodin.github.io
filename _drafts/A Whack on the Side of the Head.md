When things change and new information comes into existence, it’s no longer possible to solve current problems with yesterday’s solutions.

real key to being creative lies in what we do with our knowledge.

“Discovery consists of looking at
the same thing as everyone else
and thinking something different.”

we don’t need to be creative for most of what we do.

staying on routine thought paths enables us to do the many things we need to do without having to think about them.

we haven’t been taught to be.

These attitudes are necessary for most of what we do, but they get in the way when we’re trying to be creative.


I call these attitudes “mental locks.”

We need the ability to unlearn what we know.

our minds remain cluttered with ready-made answers, and we never have an opportunity to ask the questions that lead off the beaten path in new directions.

the history of discovery and invention is filled with people whose routines were interrupted and who were forced to come up with alternative solutions

Mental locks can be opened in one of two ways. The first technique is to become aware of them, and then to temporarily forget them when we are trying to generate new ideas. If that doesn’t work, maybe we need a “whack on the side of the head.”

It’s all a matter of setting our mental channel.

We had learned how to be specific, but we had lost much of our imaginative power.

If you have only one idea, you have only one course of action open to you, and this is quite risky in a world where flexibility is a requirement for survival.

an idea is best understood in the context of other ideas.

“We taught them how to solve problems, not recognize opportunities.

Often, it is the second right answer which, although off-beat or unusual, is exactly what you need to solve a problem in an innovative way.

change the questions you use

“The best way to get a good idea
is to get a lot of ideas.”

Different words bring in different assumptions and lead your thinking in different directions.

“My ‘forgettery’ has been just as important to my success as my memory.”

This idea of forgetting one’s assumptions to discover other answers is captured in this wonderful epigram by Heraclitus:



“When there is no sun, we can see the evening stars.”

“There are two kinds of people in this world: those who divide everything into two groups, and those who don’t.”

There are two main phases in the development of new ideas: an  imaginative one and a  practical one.

The first principle of traditional logic is the  law of noncontradiction.

inconsistency and contradiction are the hallmarks of human existence.

There are a lot of right ways to model the mind all depending on what you think is important.

The key to metaphorical thinking is similarity. In fact, this is how our thinking grows: we understand the unfamiliar by means of the similarities it has with what is familiar to us.

So,  backtracking is an effective strategy in this problem.

working backwards is another effective strategy.

third solution is to break the rules.

creative thinking is not only  constructive, it’s also  destructive.

“If you don’t ask, ‘why this?’ often enough, somebody will ask, ‘why you?’”

“Creative thinking may simply mean the realization that there is no particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done.”

The first is you can get locked into one approach,

“Aslan Phenomenon.” It runs as follows:





1.We make rules based on reasons that make a lot of sense.
2.We follow these rules.
3.Time passes, and things change.
4.The original reasons for the generation of these rules may no longer exist, but because the rules are still in place, we continue to follow them.

Some rules are so successful that they become immune to criticism. These are the “sacred cows.”

the right idea can become the wrong idea, but under certain circumstances it can become the right idea once again.

By simulating such possibilities, we can plan for the future.


Second, since our thinking is not bound by real world constraints, we can generate ideas that have no correlate in the world of experience.

“what if” someone else were solving our problem.

imagine that you’re the idea you’re trying to develop.

Stepping stones are simply provocative ideas that stimulate us to think about other ideas.

Why don’t people use “what if” thinking and stepping stones more often? There are three main reasons.  The first is that when people look at new ideas, they tend to be critical and focus on what’s out of whack.

When you judge new ideas, focus initially on their positive, interesting, and potentially useful features.

A second reason that we don’t ask “what if” more often is that this tool is low-probability in character.

The third reason we don’t use these tools is that we haven’t been taught to.

“The amount a person uses her imagination is inversely proportional to the amount of punishment she will receive for using it.”

“Necessity may be the mother of invention, but play is certainly the father.”

“Those who approach life like a child playing a game, moving and pushing pieces, possess the power of kings.”

creative ideas come from manipulating your resources — no matter how few and simple they are.

Constraints can be a powerful stimulant to the creative process.

I have a project, I’ll give myself tight mini-deadlines.

First, you put your problem in perspective.

you plant a seed in your mind. When you back away, this seed continues to grow.

when you return to an idea or problem after incubating, you’ll approach it with somewhat different assumptions.

delaying action will give you more information.

“Tom Hirschfield’s Rules of Thumb.” 





1.If you hit every time, the target’s too near — or too big.
2.Never learn details before deciding on a first approach.
3.Never state a problem to yourself in the same terms as it was brought to you.
4.The second assault on the same problem should come from a totally different direction.
5.If you don’t understand a problem, then explain it to an audience and listen to yourself.
6.Don’t mind approaches that transform one problem into another, that’s a new chance.
7.If it’s surprising, it’s useful.
8.Studying the inverse problem always helps.
9.Spend a proportion of your time analyzing your work methods.
10.If you don’t ask “Why this?” often enough, someone else will ask, “Why you?”

Two questions to ask yourself as you contemplate a current problem or issue: Where would you be better served with “less” rather than more? What problems might having “more” create for you?

some recent studies have shown that activating our basic motor functions can improve mental performance.

Twelve is a number that manifests itself in life, nature, religion, mathematics, technology, and culture in many interesting and provocative ways:

recognizing the basic idea of one situation and applying it to another

As a strategy for managing information, specialization is essential.

a strategy for getting along in the world, specialization is a necessity

The more complicated things become, the higher the walls go between the specialties.

specialization is dangerous because it can lead to the attitude “that’s not my area

Many significant advances in art, business, education, entertainment, politics, and science have come about through a cross-fertilization of ideas.

A lot of business school types analyze things to death and never get around to acting.

“Innovation is usually the result of connections of past experience. But if you have the same experiences as everybody else, you’re unlikely to look in a different direction.

A good explorer knows that looking for good ideas is like prospecting for gold. If you look in the same old places, you’ll find tapped out veins. But if you venture off the beaten path, you’ll improve your chances of discovering new idea lodes.

“Lovers of wisdom must open their minds to very many things.”

When we venture off the beaten path, sometimes we find things that are better or more exciting than what we were originally looking for.

Nothing evades our attention quite so persistently as that which we take for granted.

the best way to get along is to go along.


All of us are subject to group pressures.

Part of the price we pay for the benefits of our social existence is a piece of our own individuality.

there is the danger of “groupthink.” This is the phenomenon in which members of a group are more interested in getting the approval of other group members rather than trying to come up with creative solutions to the problems at hand.

Ask a fool what he thinks.

The fool will reverse our standard assumptions.

He is irreverent.

He might deny that a problem even exists thereby reframing the situation.

He can be absurd.

He notices things other people overlook.

The fool is metaphorical.

He’ll apply the rules of one arena to a different one.

The fool can be cryptic.

The fool believes that if you can laugh at something — be it a problem, a project, a recipe for chicken, how airplanes are designed, or your relationship with another person — then you’re more likely to think about it in a fresh way.

The comedy loosens up their thinking and establishes an environment in which people can be creative.


Why is this?  First, humor stretches your thinking.

Secondly, humor allows you to take things less seriously.

Third, humor forces you to combine ideas that are usually not associated with one another.

there’s a close relationship between the “haha” of humor and the “aha!” of discovery

It’s difficult to be creative when you have that much ego tied up in your idea.

Inventors combine components to craft new products:

Entrepreneurs bring together resources from different arenas to build new businesses:

Engineers mix different materials to create new ones:

Scientists marry diverse concepts to give birth to new models of explanation:

Poets mix unusual metaphors to create provocative images:

“You can’t see the good ideas behind you by looking twice as hard at what’s in front of you.”

The fool believes that thinking about and doing things opposite from your customary way allows you to discover the things you typically overlook.

When you do the opposite of what people are expecting, chances are good that you’ll catch them off-guard and be more successful in reaching your objective.

If a thing’s worth doing, it’s okay to do it poorly.

As a matter of fact, many systems have weak links designed into them. They’re called “fuses.” When a system gets overloaded, the fuse blows and saves the rest of the system.

Nothing succeeds like mediocrity because everyone understands it so well.

So, one way to “think something different” is to look at things ambiguously.

posing a problem in an ambiguous way would give more freedom to the imaginations of the people who were working on it.

“seeing the paradox” is at the crux of creative thinking — the ability to entertain two different, often contradictory, notions at the same time.

We can create an oracle in the same way the medicine man did. Three things are required:

This question focuses our thinking.

way to generate a random piece of information.

An attitude that interprets the resulting random piece of information as the answer to our question.

Remember: Often those ideas that initially seem the least relevant become the most important ones of all because they point to something that you’ve been completely overlooking.

At face value, dreams can appear to be weird or meaningless. But if you use them as stimulants to your imagination, and try various ways of interpreting them, you may discover something that will lead your thinking in a new direction.

The same energy that generates creative ideas also produces errors.

you learn not to put yourself in situations where you might fail. This leads to conservative thought patterns designed to avoid “failure.”

An inventor is simply a person who doesn’t take his education too seriously.

Negative feedback means that the current approach isn’t working, and it’s up to you to find a new one.

success tends to lock us into a pattern,

success — perversely enough — can create situations that undermine our original intentions

The third danger of success is that it can lead to our being over-confident to the point of arrogance.

“There is a greater need to extinguish arrogance than a blazing fire.”

the self-fulfilling prophecy is a place where the world of thought overlaps with the world of action.

one of the chief differences between winners and losers is that winners see themselves as winning and losers generally give themselves a reason or an excuse to lose.

the people who didn’t think they were creative never put themselves in a position where they could use their creativity.

“Ideas are great, but they aren’t worth much if you don’t use them.

I’ve concluded that people who are successful in the creative process are able to adopt four main roles, each of which embodies a different type of thinking. These roles are:


Explorer



Artist



Judge



Warrior

• Your Explorer is your role for searching for new information and resources;
• Your Artist is your role for turning these resources into new ideas;
• Your Judge is your role for evaluating the merits of an idea and deciding what to do with it; and,
• Your Warrior is your role for carrying your idea into action.

“There are two main reasons for low creative performance:  weak roles and  bad timing.

Don’t wait for your idea to happen. Make it happen.

How can you create a support system around you?

Sometimes it takes more creativity to get rid of the excuses we put in the way than it does to come up with the idea in the first place.

Strengthen your “risk muscle.” Everyone has one. You keep it in shape by trying new things.

Have something at stake — survival, self-esteem, money, reputation — so that you’ll be motivated to make your idea successful.

Dissatisfaction can be beneficial to the creative process.

Two basic rules of life are: 1) change is inevitable; and 2) everybody resists change.

How can you make your idea more attractive to other people?

For many people, the ultimate inspiration is the deadline. That’s when you have to put away your excuses and get down to the business of making your idea happen.

How persistent are you?

After you implement your idea, give yourself “a pat on the back. And then go out and earn another one.”
