 The biggest reason I don’t want kids is because I know, as a woman, I am automatically disadvantaged. My boyfriend is absolutely wonderful but I know for a fact I’d be the one stuck with a majority of the childcare. I’d be expected to take on all the responsibility and he’d be at work all day. 

I will absolutely never submit myself to that.
