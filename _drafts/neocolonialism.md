- Union Carbide, an American conglomerate, set up a plant for processing pesticides in the impoverished city of Bhopal in India. Due to a lack of sales, they cut back vast numbers of qualified staff in favour of unqualified locals, stopped paying for maintenance or making checks, and gradually dismissed all safety procedures in order to maximise profit. It was an accident waiting to happen. Union Carbide knew this and ignored it. One evening, a storage tank overflowed and an invisible cloud of toxic denser-than-air gas spread across the city, filling the lungs of anyone asleep on the ground floor and asphyxiating them. Thousands of people woke up suddenly unable to breathe and just died in their beds. There have been some claims of over sixteen thousand deaths. Union Carbide immediately flew all of its American employees out of India and hid them behind the US government. They avoided taking responsibility for years.
