### My story

My name is Easton. I'm 20 years old and I'm a junior at Marist College. I am a captain of the men's track & field team. I'm from a small town in Massachusetts called Dalton. I come from a big family, with 3 sisters and a brother, along with lots of aunts, uncles, cousins, and my dad's favorite child, our dog Charli. In high school, I played basketball and soccer and continue to play intramurals here at Marist. I also love watching sports, particularly the Celtics. I'm super competitive and hold myself to a high standard in anything that I do. I am very organized and stay on top of the work that I have to do (most of the time!) I enjoy working with computers, but I also love talking to people and meeting new people. A fun fact about me is that I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 2 minutes.
