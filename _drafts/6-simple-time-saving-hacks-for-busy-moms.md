Let's talk about those simple time saving hacks. As our family has grown, I've noticed how much better I must get at watching the time...or _the time is just gone in a flash_! Some days, I look down and it's 9am and then somehow it turns into 9pm. Some days it flies by without realizing it. That's why I'm a big fan of figuring out those small, simple time saving hacks for our family. They all can really add up and free up so much extra free time in a home. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about **6 simple time saving hacks for busy moms**.

1. **Create boundaries around cleaning and tidying.** Before we did this in our home? I felt like I was CONSTANTLY cleaning and tidying the kitchen or elsewhere all day. Now we tackle the kitchen in full after supper every evening, creating a boundary around that so I don't have to feel like I have to clean it in full any other time.
2. **Prepare for the morning the night before.** Elizabeth over at  
   [@athomeontheprairie](https://www.instagram.com/athomeontheprairie/) on Instagram and [@carleenarmstead](https://www.instagram.com/carleenarmstead/) are so good at reminding moms to prepare the night before for the next [morning](https://www.instagram.com/carleenarmstead/)! It can really help save time and lead to smoother mornings.
3. **Meal plan.** I don't know what your house is like, butttt if I don't have my ducks in a row with meals, then it's a gong show here lol.

1. Deal with wet laundry right away. Am I the only one who forgets about wet laundry and then have to wash it again? Building laundry into specific times of the day has helped so much with saving time for our family! We throw on the wash at breakfast and I dry at lunch.

1. Bulk cook. Bulk coooking can help so much. Sauces, rice, chopping veggies. It all can help save time.
2. Put away, organize, and declutter as we go. We're really working on this habit, but if you see it and are walking by it, pick it up and put it away vs letting it sit for the future.

### My journey to creating a simpler home

About five years ago, I started my journey to simplifying. I was a stressed out, super high expectations mom, and had no solid routines or systems in place for our home. This was when I realized something needed to change. I started with decluttering and then everything snowballed from there.
