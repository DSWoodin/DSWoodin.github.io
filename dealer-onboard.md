# Artist alley information

First: a little bit of background.&nbsp; We’ve been thinking a lot about just what a virtual artist alley should look like, and how to make it as easy as possible for an artist to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

After talking to a lot of furries, it seems the most common way a customer uses an artist alley is to browse up and down the aisles, make a note of who and what they like, and then finally go to the artists they like for a commission.&nbsp; We also have talked to several artists, and many of them already have a platform such as twitch or Picarto they already stream on and they want to use that as often as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The way we want to recreate this is to have an “alley hall” that shows every artist in the alley, with a live video rotating through all of the live streams on one page.&nbsp; Under that there will be a listing page with links to everyone’s personal page or more information on commissions.&nbsp; This gives the customer an overview of everyone currently streaming and then shows them a way for them to click through to an artist’s stream page.&nbsp; We’ve spent the last couple of months working behind the scenes on something unique that checks all these boxes.&nbsp;

This system we will be using today will allow us to broadcast a copy of your video stream at the same time as you stream to your preferred platform.&nbsp; To do this will take a little bit of prep work on your end, but should be mostly painless.&nbsp; This guide will focus on those that use OBS, those that use Streamlabs, and a super basic option for those people that have never streamed before.&nbsp; Google chrome is the recommended browser, but this has been tested with Opera and Firefox (but use chrome if you can, it just works™)

## Prep work

If you already use some kind of streaming software, you’ll need to set up some things in advance.&nbsp; You’ll be using a virtual camera to send your video to our service, which allows you to continue to stream wherever you’d like unaffected by our side.

&nbsp;

### OBS:

First, make sure that you’ve updated to the newest version of OBS.&nbsp; They recently added virtual camera output.&nbsp; If the bottom right of OBS looks like this to you, you’re set

### Streamlabs:

You got it a bit easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, make sure that your streamlabs is up to date

Open Streamlabs OBS<br>Click Settings<br>Click on Virtual Webcam<br>Click on Install Virtual Webcam<br>Click start virtual webcam<br>Have a snack

All the info you’ll need is on this page:

### Streaming to us:

You’ll also get a request to allow your webcam.&nbsp; Click accept&nbsp;

You’ll have two options.&nbsp; Click “join room with camera”

Select “OBS camera” or “Streamlabs OBS”&nbsp; as your video source and no audio.

When you’re ready to begin, click start.&nbsp; We’ll know you’re streaming and take it from there\!

The page should change to a message from the runners of the stream..&nbsp;

You can also start to stream to your preferred platform like normal, our system operates like a second stream that is unconnected to that one.

If you want to stop your stream to us, click the bottom right icon on the webpage.&nbsp;

### I don’t have any stream software and I just want to share my art program:

Don’t worry, we got you covered too\!

First, open your preferred art program.

go to the following link
