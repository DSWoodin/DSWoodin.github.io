<h2>8-21-2020 Update</h2>
<p>
    Since the schools are physically closed to begin the year, we're not yet sure how the math club will operate.
    In the meantime, stay tuned to [Bear Tracks](https://emailoctopus.com/lists/b1bc567a-d35d-11ea-a3d0-06b4694bee2a/forms/subscribe) 
    for more details. Once the year gets going, we will return to communicating through our own email list.
</p>
<p>We are tracking the following competitions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mathcounts will be held entirely online this year. We will still participate fully in this competition, although the
        process to select our school team of 15 has yet to be determined.
    </li>
    <li>
        A date has been set for the AMC 8, although it's unclear what role the schools will have in driving it. We cannot host
        the exam onsite, so we're waiting to understand what the online alternative is.
    </li>
    <li>
        We are tracking local competitions (Math is Cool, Mustang Math Tournament, Knights of Pi, and Washington State Math
        Championships/Blaine). There is nothing to report yet.        
    </li>
