### Overview
With the exception of [project courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2019-08-22-project-courses/), MDS courses will typically have two quizzes throughout the block, typically one in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between blocks. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being ~~30 minutes~~ 40 minutes long.

_2020-2021 changes:_ Students will have **40 minutes** to complete quizzes to account for internet connectivity issues, etc. We will keep the same number/length of the questions (i.e., they won't be made 33% longer to use up 33% more time).

### Purpose
The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain.

### Difficulty
In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Format

Quizzes will typically be through [Canvas](canvas.ubc.ca). Unlike labs, quizzes will be performed within a defined time period ~~and will be supervised by MDS instructional staff.~~

~~Upon arriving to the quiz room:~~

~~1. If the quiz is being held in lab, you must attend your designated lab section.~~
~~2. Sign the attendance sheet, that the TA or lab instructor has.~~

At the start of the quiz period:

1. Go to <https://canvas.ubc.ca>, and log in with your CWL.
2. Navigate to the relevant quiz on the relevant course page.
3. Begin the quiz, fill out your answers, and click "submit". You will have a countdown timer to complete the quiz.
4. Wait quietly until the quiz time slot finishes. The TA or lab instructor will specify when the quiz period is finished. 

We recommend you start the quiz within 2 minutes of the quiz period starting, so that you have the full ~~30 minutes~~ 40 minutes to write the quiz.

_2020-2021 changes:_ Quizzes will not be supervised and will be 40 minutes. 

### Closed-book (ignore for 2020-2021)

~~Unless otherwise specified, **quizzes will be closed-book** except for offline documentation only (e.g., help in RStudio and Jupyter notebook). This means that during the quiz students are expected to:

  - ~~**not** use the internet to solve questions on the quiz~~
  - ~~**not** bring any materials into the quiz that would be of assistance in completing the quiz (aside from a laptop)~~
  - ~~**not** open other files inside RStudio or Jupyter beyond those provided in the quiz repo~~
  - ~~**not** leave the quiz room early with your laptop, and not come back into the quiz room after leaving (other than for purposes such as using the washroom)~~

~~You are allowed to consult documentation within R/Python or your IDE (e.g., RStudio). However, time is very limited on quizzes and we anticipate that you will be more successful if you are fluent with common functions and don't need to rely too heavily on the documentation.~~

### No collaboration

You may **not** communicate with other students or anyone else, through any medium, at any time during the quiz. You may not communicate with any of your classmates until everyone is finished the quiz. Please don't post about MDS quizzes on Slack until at least 30 minutes after the end of the quiz, in case some students were given extra time.


### General Guidelines

There is rarely a need to write more than two brief sentences for any given question. 

### Special Circumstances

#### I cannot submit the quiz!

Take screen shots of your completed quiz, and send them through Slack to the lab instructor of the course before the end of the quiz period.

#### I'm finished the quiz early (ignore for 2020-21)

~~Wait quietly with your laptop closed/ajar until the end of the quiz period.~~

#### I need to use the washroom

Just leave your laptop in the quiz room. 

_2020-2021 changes:_ You can take your laptop with you if you really want...

### Instructions for TAs (does not apply for 2020-21)

1. ~~Go to the classroom at least 5 mins before the quiz time.~~
2. ~~Bring a blank sheet of paper with you. Pass it around a couple of minutes before the quiz starts and ask the students to write their name on it. You can hand it or take a picture and send it to us later. ~~
3. ~~Try to walk around and make sure that at least one of the TAs stays at the back of the classroom.~~
4. ~~Report to us if you observe any form of academic dishonesty or chatting in the classroom.~~
5. ~~Ask the students to stay in the classroom for the full time even after they are done. (If students start leaving the classroom it can be distracting for other students.)~~
6. If you encounter issues during the quiz, inform the lab instructor through Slack.
