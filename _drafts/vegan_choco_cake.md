 Two things, depending on the kind of dinner they'll be following: light and resfreshing [vegan lemon bars](http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/vegetarian-recipes/vegan-lemon-bars.php)-- I always use a *generous* amount of lemon juice, a bit more than the recipe calls for, and my fluffy, rich-tasting black magic cake.

**Black magic cake**
12 servings, 35 minutes, 10 minutes prep

* 1 ½ cups flour
* 1/2 cup cocoa 
* 1 1/2 cups brown sugar (I cut this down to 1 cup once and it was still good)
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 
* 1 teaspoon salt 
* 3/4 cup coffee 
* 3/4 cup soy milk 
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil 
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional-- they sort of interrupt the fluffiness)

1. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, and salt. 
2. In a separate bowl, combine the coffee, soy milk, and oil. 
3. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and mix; then stir in the nuts and chocolate chips. 
4. Pour batter (it will be quite liquidy) into a greased 9x9" pan (I think my square pan is 8in)
5. Bake at 325º for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. 
6. For a smaller pan, the baking time could be substantially longer.
