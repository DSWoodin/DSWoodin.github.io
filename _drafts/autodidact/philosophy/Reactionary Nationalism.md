Reactionary Nationalism will always look like this, because patriotism is a cover story for the creeping-style fascism of authoritarianism. Always has been.

You see it in Colombia, Australia, Poland, England, Brazil, etc, Reactionaries ALWAYS use the "good of the country" AND NEVER "the good of the PEOPLE"

Because, to them, you're not part of their nation

[edit: at this point it's probably worth defining that FLYING a flag and appreciating your national culture are VASTLY different from the toxic fetishization of national identity that reactionary propaganda requires as an effective petri dish for anti-progressive rhetoric]
