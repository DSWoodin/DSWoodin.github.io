title: Review English in January
tags: [English]

I made plans to check How My English is improving every 15th of them each month. This is the first review. From last year, I’ve been using [Ringle](https://www.ringleplus.com/) for getting Tutoring. That service is quite helpful. After every lesson finished, Tutor gives me feedback with a score. I think this score is meaningful because It’s given by native speakers. I've recorded these data and made a chart that is attached below. I check How My score is changed and their feedback. This would be helpful
 to check what is my flaw back in my English.

I check How to learn English for now too. Last year, I had a plan for every day for a week. For instance, Monday is to watch Youtube, Tuesday is for a reading article. Recently I changed this schedule because I have to explain my works to my colleagues. Every night I prepare sentences for explaining to my colleagues what issue I work on. Previously I prepare it in short sentences, but now I try to explain as details as I can. Usually, It takes a lot of time. After finished it, I watch Youtube or read a book.

I will keep doing this until It has not problem.
