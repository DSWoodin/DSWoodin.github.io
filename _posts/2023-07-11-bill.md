After twenty years doing house and flat renovations I've reached retirement age. These days I prefer less strenuous work but I'm still good for the smaller stuff.

Here are examples of tasks I can do for you:
 - Decorate a room
 - Assemble flat packs
 - Fit shelving
 - Fix kitchen cabinets
 - Lay tiles
 - Silicone a bath or sink
 - Repair damaged walls or plasterboard
 
That's just a selection. Feel free to ask about other tasks. If its something I can take on I'll be happy to give you a quote.

Here are tasks I won't take on:
  - Longer jobs (three days maximum is a guide) 
  - Electrical work
  - Plumbing (not even tap washers)
  - Double-glazed window or door systems
  - Extensive exterior painting
  - Extensive flooring work
