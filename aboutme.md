## Hi, I'm Andrew

I am currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am dual-enrolled as an undergraduate senior and first year master's student.  I am a candidate in the Robotics Master's Program, with a focus in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.  For my undergraduate degree, I study Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM), with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.  Robotics and AI are my passions, and hopefully this website provides a platform for me to flex some my projects, as well as a creative outlet for my interests.

#### Sorry, in English:

I was born and raised in Philadelphia, and now I attend the University of Pennsylvania.  Although I've always felt at home in Philadelphia, I'm a pretty restless person.  As a way to explore the world, my own spirituality, and serve those in need, I went on several volunteer trips to Asia throughout high school.  I've travelled to the Himalayas of Central Asia and spent a summer teaching English and Math at a government primary school.  While there, I experienced some pretty crazy altitude sickness and got lost in some huge cities, but all in all, I consider this one of my favorite summers ever.  I've also travelled to Southeast Asia, where I kayaked in Ha Long Bay, tasted roasted tarantula in the Cambodian jungle, and watched the sun rise over Angkor Wat.  I also worked in a government primary school and helped build a sleeping quarters for orphaned students.

Once I graduated high school, I felt like my biggest priority became my studies.  Since then, I have not looked back.  STEM subjects are CHALLENGING.  There's no other way to put it.  When I came to Penn as a Mechanical Engineering and Math major, I quickly realized how large of a jump I had made from high school.  My applied physics and math coursework got me really interested in mechanics, linear algebra, dynamics, etc, but also took a few years off the end of my life.  I took this interest into some research projects, like [this one](https://github.com/geande/geande.github.io/edit/main/README.md) and [this one](https://github.com/geande/geande.github.io/edit/main/README.md).  These projects became a way for me to explore concepts in a scientific way, which really suits how I approach tasks.  Alongside these projects, I worked through my major curriculum, and decided to start taking some computer science courses.  Almost immediately, I got hooked on coding.  For about a year, my interests in MEAM and CS competed for my main focus, but eventually I found myself much more satisfied and interested in CS.  For a while, I didn't want to admit this to myself because I was afraid of being the guy that "majored in the wrong thing in college."  It was probably about this time that the I discovered the incredibly beautiful field of Machine Learning.  Taking my first Machine Learning course in college was transformtive and propelled me to apply to the submatriculation program in robotics
