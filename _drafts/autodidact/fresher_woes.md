 Thanks. Frustrating beyond means to finish these super pricey, time consuming degrees and then the moment you're in industry look around like, "Docker? No idea how to use that. Kubernetes? How's that spelled, exactly? Maven? Build tool? You mean like ctrl+f12 in Eclipse? Grep? Is it a bug? Is it in this office?". Holy fuck Universities and Industry need to collaborate more man.
