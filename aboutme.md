## Who am I?

My name is Francesco, usually Franco.

I am a musician with various passions ranging from programming, artificial intelligence, art and all those forms of “creation” that solve problems or generate real emotions.

## What do I do?

I teach as a multimedia language teacher in a high school.

I currently divide myself between music production, smart contracts programming and some machine learning algorithm for educational and research.

## What do I like?

I like to be interested in many different disciplines, among my favorites are quantum physics, astrophysics, space, cinema and literature.
