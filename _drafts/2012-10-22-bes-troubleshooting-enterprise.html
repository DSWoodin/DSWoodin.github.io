Troubleshooting the enterprise activation process can be broken down into 4 stages – when troubleshooting activation issues, let the process complete or until an error messages appears.<br/><br/><a href="http://syswow64blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/bes-chart.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-170" title="BES-Chart" alt="" src="http://syswow64blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/bes-chart.png" height="302" width="610" /></a><br/><br/>For more help with Enterprise Activation issues – <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb13852" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb13852">KB13852</a><br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>1.1.1        Stage 1 – Authentication<br/><br/>1.       The BESAdmin creates a new user and assigns an activation password using the Blackberry Manager (4.1.x) or the Blackberry Administration Service (5.0.X). The user list store in the blackberry Configuration Database is updated with the new user name, email address, mailbox information, activation password, activation status and other user account information.<br/><br/><b>Points of Failure – </b>BAS, Configuration Database<br/><br/><b> </b><br/><br/>2.       The Blackberry Dispatcher assigns the new user to a Blackberry Messaging Agent. The Blackberry Messaging Agent starts to monitor the user’s mailbox on the messaging server for new email messages. An email message containing the ETP.dat file attachment is required to continue the activation process over the Vodafone Network.<br/><br/><b>Points of Failure – </b>Dispatcher, Messaging Agent<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>3.       The user goes to the Enterprise Activation screen on the blackberry and enters the email address and activation password. The user selects the menu key and clicks Activate. The blackberry displays <b><i>Activating <a href="mailto:username@company_name.com">username@company_name.com</a></i></b><br/><br/><b>Points of Failure – </b>Device<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>4.       The Blackberry creates an activation request email message that contains the email address, PIN and public key authentication information, based on the activation password typed in by the user. The activation request email message is encrypted and is sent to the RIM Relay over the Vodafone Network.<br/><br/><b>Points of Failure – </b>Device, Network<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>5.       The RIM Relay receives the activation email message and identifies uit as an activation request. The RIM Relay forwards the email message using SMTP to the email address that was used for the Enterprise Activation screen.<br/><br/><b>Points of Failure </b>– Antivirus software, spam filters, provisioning, users mailbox, messaging server, network<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><table border="0"><br/><tbody><br/><tr><br/><td><b>Issue</b></td><br/><td><b>Reason </b></td><br/><td><b>Solution</b></td><br/></tr><br/><tr><br/><td>Failure to add user to the BES</td><br/><td>Incorrect permissions for the BESAdmin account</td><br/><td>Ensure the permissions are correct for the BESAdmin account – <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb02276" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb02276">KB02276</a></td><br/></tr><br/><tr><br/><td><b> </b></td><br/><td>Incorrect MAPI subsystem installed on the BES</td><br/><td>Ensure the MAPIsubsystem is equal or higher than the Exchange versions – <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10197" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10197">KB10197</a><br/><br/>Recreate the MAPI profile – <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10285" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10285">KB10285</a></td><br/></tr><br/><tr><br/><td><b> </b></td><br/><td>User Data cannot be written to the BB Configuration Database</td><br/><td>Backup the BB Configuration Database - <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10292" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10292">KB10292</a> and increase the size - <a title="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10969" href="http://blackberry.com/btsc/kb10969">KB10969</a></td><br/></tr><br/><tr><br/><td><b>An Error has occurred.

The Blackberry device now displays the message <b><i>Encryption Verified.

The Blackberry Policy Service adds the unique authentication key that the Blackberry Domain uses to sign IT policy data and then forwards the IT policy data through the Blackberry Dispatcher to the Blackberry Router and then to the Blackberry device. The Blackberry Policy Service waits for confirmation from the Blackberry device that the IT policy has been applied successfully.<br/><br/><b>Points of Failure – C</b>onfiguration database, Messaging Agent, Policy Service, Blackberry device<br/><br/><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/>5.       The Blackberry device applies the IT policy and sends a confirmation to the BES.
