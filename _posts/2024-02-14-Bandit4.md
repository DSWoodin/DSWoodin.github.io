# Bandit4 - 5


### Password: lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR


## Things to Know


1. **What is ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**

   A file that contains data made up of ASCII characters. It is essentially raw text just like the words you are reading now.



## Problem


**Bandit Level 4 - Level 5**


**Level Goal**


The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.




## Solving


1. **Check ou which files and folders are located in the home directory**


- At first, I checked out files and folders in the home directory. There was `inhere` folder 

    `ls`

2. **Check the files if it is human-readable**

   - `file inhere/*` means that I want to check all the files in the inhere fold

   - `inhere/-file07` is ASCII text file, which is human-readable. 

   - Read the file `cat inhere/-file07`
