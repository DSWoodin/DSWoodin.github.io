Everything that is done well is usually done with a good plan. Are you feeling scatter brained and would like to work on becoming more organized? If so, this blog may help you out today. I'm sharing about the first simple planning step to take as a beginner planner.   
  
The first simple planning step: write things down.   
  
Why write things down? There are a lot of benefits to writing things down, but here are three of them:  
  
It helps commit to memory better.   
It helps you to follow through with plans better.   
It reduces mental load.   
  
Here is a blog Link to more benefits to writing things down.   
  
If you are working on a new habit, a routine, a project, new ideas or planning a vacation..really anything that is floating around your brain. Try writing it down.   
  
Research shows that we are better able to "prioritize which we should focus on and act on at any given moment" if we write things down. Productive and free. Com  
  
Tips for the first step to take as a beginner planner  
  
Commit to a time to write things down if it's for daily planning. I tend to take five minutes every night.  
  
Have a notebook or digital notepad nearby to jot things down as they pop into your mind. How many hours have I wasted trying to remember what I forgot to write down? It still happens sometimes and every time I remind myself that I can't not write things down.  
  
Conclusion  
  
The first simple planning step to take as a beginner planner need not be complicated. Make a commitment, stick to it, and try things out over time. And before you know it, you'll have your life a bit more organized and planned...you may even call yourself a planner by then too. Happy planning!
