Resources I use for my PhD

[Invasive species research]("")
My phd research
Draft manuscripts

Here is the [webpage]("https://github.com/davan690/davan690.github.io/") repository for more computer minded (open-source resources and my research), and a [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/")/[twitter]("") feed for new blog posts about statistics and ecology (not all from me). Welcome to the "Pit of Success!" ^[Wickham quote]
