## Abstract

The spin, as a basic parameter describing the black hole, is imprinted with the information of the formation and evolution of the black hole, and is considered to be the energetic source for powering relativistic jets. The relativistic X-ray reflections are usually observed in the the black hole systems, and can be used to measure the spin of black holes with different mass scales. Is this report, I focus on the spin measurements of the black holes in X-ray binary systems via X-ray reflection method. The phenomenon of high iron abundance and steep emissivity profile are discussed. It is suggested that the higher density accretion disc and the ionization gradient along the accretion disc should be considered in the future reflection models.
