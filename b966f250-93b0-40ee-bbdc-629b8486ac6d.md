 This is why I believe in the importance of teaching our girls to support each other and supporting each other as women. 

Men will come and go, but many of your close woman  friendships are for a lifetime. 

I’ve literally watched women change their life with just a shred of support and care from other women when they had no hope. 

Turning women on their own kind is a divide and conquer technique. That is why the “not like other girls” trope is so toxic when men say it to you.
