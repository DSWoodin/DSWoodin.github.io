This is my first post, how exciting! I don't claim to have a good memory. In fact, I claim the exact opposite. This blog will be a place for me to jot things down so I can come back to them when I forget how to do a certain thing, which will be quite often. My hope is that other's out there reading this can get some use out of my writings.
