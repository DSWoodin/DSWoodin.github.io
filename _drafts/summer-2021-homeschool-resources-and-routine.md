We homeschool year round and take breaks as needed currently. It's been what works best for our family. There are certainly times where we take it slower like around the holidays and summer season. Today, I'm sharing with you **our summer homeschool plans and routine for 2021**.

### OVERVIEW OF OUR HOMESCHOOL

Our homeschool makeup compromises of four children ages ten to two. Three boys and a toddler girl, for reference.

**_Spine curriculum:_** We use [Ambleside Online](https://www.amblesideonline.org/) and supplement or replace things here and there, such as for religion. Ambleside has pretty much laid out the path for how we go about homeschooling and helped me let go of a lot of decision faitgue, which I am grateful for!

### SUMMER HOMESCHOOL ROUTINE

We gather together for breakfast and start either during breakfast, or right after then. We do morning time activities together, a subject, and then break off into independent work. The ideal start time is around 8 and to be finished by ideally 10. Lunch time we gather again and listen to podcasts usually, sometimes read aloud. After lunch, we have our year round [quiet time routine](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-have-quiet-time-with-kids/), which I describe below.

A note about routines in general: Our routine and plans tend to change often because I periodically assess what needs to be tweaked (are we doing too much? Too little? Do we need a break? Does something need to be prioritized more?). But, taking the time to plan in advance is so, so helpful in allowing our days to be simpler and smoother. Having a foundation to work from and then tweak a little bit here and needed.  
**_My rule of thumb is:_** _If the routine doesn't feel good, it likely needs some tweaking!_
