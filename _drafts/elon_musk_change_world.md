 Elon Musk is a tool and a moronic hack. Albert Einstein came up with the theory of relativity when he was bored and daydreaming. Darwin specifically tried to get as much free time as possible so that he could do what he wanted to. When people are given free time to pursue their own interests, that is when they “change the world”. They don’t “change the world” by being forced to devote all their time and energy slaving away for overpaid dirtbags like Musk. 

And as a secondary point, the vast majority of people who “changed the world” didn’t do it for the better. Hitler “changed the world”. Alexander “the great” (I strongly object to a genocidal maniac war criminal with delusions of grandeur being described as “great” in modern society) “changed the world”. The fucking Atomic Bomb “changed the world”. People who admit they want to “change the world” but don’t specify HOW should be looked on with suspicion, rather than respect.
