## Abstract

Monitoring signals in the physical world usually have typical nonlinear characteristics. Faced with the problems of complexity, uncertainty and multi-modality in the actual signal generation, constructing a time-frequency analysis method that can effectively describe the nonlinear characteristics of the signal is an effective tool to solve many key problems in the study of nonlinear physical characteristics . However, traditional time-frequency analysis methods are often limited by Heisenbergâ€™s uncertainty principle, which results in serious divergence of time-spectrum energy and ambiguous features. It is difficult to provide high-resolution time-frequency analysis results, and it is easy to cause low accuracy and poor reliability of the analysis system. , Or even misanalyzed. Pioneer of time-frequency analysis and Professor Boashash, an IEEE Fellow, pointed out: How to improve energy concentration and time-frequency resolution, preserve the physical properties after signal reconstruction, and whether fast calculation can be achieved are the three key points for time-frequency analysis methods that need to be broken through problem.
