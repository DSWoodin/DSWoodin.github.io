## Abstract

Microlensing has become a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets beyond the snowline and free-floating planets. In this talk, I will first discuss the basic concepts of gravitational microlensing, and then review some of the recent progress on the discovery of extrasolar planets with microlensing with space satellites and the current generation of ground-based surveys.
