 My ex did this. Spent ALL his time at work (I’m talking 3am on a Sunday) but literally was just goofing off. He’d then pull all nighters to get a project done, and all his coworkers thought he was *such* a hard worker. He hated that I was never impressed by his all-nighters, because he could have just done the work when he was goofing off.

This is not the norm here by the way, but it still got him praise.
