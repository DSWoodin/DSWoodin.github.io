 Something like that happened to me with my father.

Growing up, my father was a fun guy, you know? He was the typical dad, kinda nerdy and funny. He had an abundance of dad jokes and let me sit on his shoulders and tucked me into bed every night and wiped my tears and held my tiny hand in his large, weathered one and did every single thing I'd ever want a dad to do.

I guess it changed when I was ten or so and my older cousin bought me a dress. It was black and sleeveless with a dark blue bow and reached around my knees. I wore it once out to a birthday dinner with my mum and I loved how it twirled. Once I got home, my father made me throw it in the trash, because  women who wore things like that were bringing shame to the family name, were dragging his face through the mud.

All through my teens I was constantly disillusioned. I wasn't allowed to wear sleeveless or off-the-shoulder tops or shorts outside the house. I was constantly pressured into hiding pads from him in black plastic bags. I started noticing how he treated my mum - with dismissal and derision. She was never smart enough, she was never informed enough, she was never enough to be respected. It got worse once I started learning about her marriage - how he was silent as his family forced her to stop working and have children, how he stole any semblance of financial independence she had.

I always thought that I was a strong, independent woman in a developed, egalitarian society who would never stand for any bullshit from a man who thinks he's better than me. I didn't need feminism because I had achieved the goal. *But I hadn't.* Sexism had always been a part of my family heritage and I had been too blind to see it.

I love my father, and I always will. But he has shown me that the fight isn't over, that I always have to be on the lookout for people around me who treat me worse because of my gender. I guess that's just one more thing he's taught me about life.
