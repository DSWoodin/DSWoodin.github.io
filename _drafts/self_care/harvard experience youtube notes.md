[[self_care]]
exclusion for the sake of exclusivity

Facing constant rejection in
spite of working really hard

and doing your best is
rough on the psyche.

It can really mess with
your sense of self-worth.

You can feel like you're doing terribly

within this environment
of super achievers,

whereas in the grand scheme of things,

if you step outside of the Harvard bubble,

you're doing fine.

If there's anything that I
could say to my previous self

it would be, "Ahsante, you're doing fine.

The opinions of these
people will not matter

at the end of four years,
you're doing fine."

And even if you are doing well,

you can feel like you
aren't doing well enough.

You never stop comparing

and you can easily feel like
you're not measuring up.

Like you have less value
than your peers do.

Like you're not getting enough accolades.

Like you're not getting

into the really esteemed organizations.

And at this point, your
entire life is school.

And those esteemed organizations
feel like they matter.

They have a lot of power
and influence on campus.

Everything in the vicinity
is oriented towards Harvard.

So that becomes your whole life,

and if your whole life, your
entire environment is saying,

"You're not good enough.

You can't sit with us."

Even though you've
worked hard to get here,

and now hard work isn't enough,

and there's always more work to do.

There's an overwhelming
amount of reading to do.

The piece sets are unreasonably long,

and it seems like everyone
around you is doing better

than you are and you don't measure up.

You're not as valuable.

You feel inferior, you feel worthless,

ostracized, isolated, alone, terrible,

and you start to wonder, what's the point.

The mental health services on campus

we're not known to be very helpful.

Peer counseling was the most visible way

to get mental health support on campus.

Students trying to help
other students like,

"Don't freak out, don't do it.

Just talk to someone, we're here."

And I think if I didn't have a loving,

caring home environment with parents

that I knew would support me

even if I decided I needed to drop out

which I strongly considered
in my junior year.

If I hadn't had that escape hatch,

and I thought that this
was my make or break thing,

and I had to make it work at Harvard,

then I would have been
in a much worse place.

So that was the biggest cost for me,

it was the psychological distress,

it was the constant rejection
that I was unprepared for,

a lot of feelings of worthlessness

and a lot of things that
felt acutely painful

even years afterwards.

And I spent the next five years
clawing my way out of that.

I spent five years healing and
detaching my sense of value

as a person from my achievements,

or my level of productivity or
my relative status to others.

I had to unlearn the patterns

of hierarchy and competition
and chasing recognition

from others that are deeply
embedded in schooling

and in society, but can make
you absolutely miserable

even if you are outwardly successful.

And that's why I'm so
adamant about self-care

and self-love and mental
health on my channel.

I don't wanna make it seem

like I had no friends in college

or that my experience was
all bad, it wasn't all bad.

There were certain
classes, certain people,

certain professors that
I really vibed with.

The best semester I had was
when I got the heck off campus,

and I studied abroad in
Buenos Aires, Argentina,

that was through a Harvard program.

I wouldn't be doing video production today

if it weren't for the encouragement
of my film professors.

And even though I didn't really fit

into any established social group,

I really leaned on the
friends that I lived with.

We were all going through
that mess together.

And when you've been through
the fire with someone,

it bonds you, like y'all
been through it together.

So I have a couple of
girlfriends from college

who I intend to be friends with for life.

There's a big difference

between resonating with a few
individuals within the space

and resonating with the space
and the culture as a whole.

At the same time going

through a competitive
cutthroat environment

where who you knew and
who liked you mattered

just as much as what you did,

prepared me well for the
capitalist workforce.

Like if I can make it through that level

of anxiety and stress
and constant competition,

then I can make it anywhere.

I have a lot of mental fortitude

from going through the fire,

like what doesn't kill
you, makes you stronger.

You know what I'm saying?

Like we're tough now, okay?

(chuckling) All right? I'm
not physically fighting anyone

and being in such a toxic environment

where I never felt like I really belonged,

makes me really appreciate
when I do find communities

where I feel a sense of belonging

and being fully appreciated and valued.

So the experience at Harvard has given me

a lot of valuable perspective,
