[[feminism]]

 I studied religions most of my life and one thing I can say with 100% certainty is that every single world-wide monotheistic religions (Buddhism included, which surprised me) condemn women, no matter how people try to twist the meaning of their respective books, objectivity says so. Their prevalence in society only cemented my beliefs for the need of feminism today and for some years to come especially. No matter how "woke" and "purely scientific" some societies claim to be, there is always this underlying disgust for strong -actual- feminity. The women are seen as either non-existent, untouchable or a bad sexual influence for the apparently-should-be sterile males. What a good foundation for people to root their views on!
The opposite is also true, for exemple we see countries like sweden being really open, coincidentally, their ancestors worshiped goddesses as well as gods.
I guess what I'm trying to say is the most influencing religions of our societies hold a pretty eye-opening view into our subconscious, and ultimately into our global problems. We try to ignore it, but I don't think we should. I guess it's my job to work on that since I studied it. Oh well.
