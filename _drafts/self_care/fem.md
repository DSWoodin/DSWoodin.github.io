 i have for sure had sex with guys because it was easier than performing the emotional labor of them making me explain why i was rejecting them.

also for the younger ladies in the room... no one has actually cared or even asked for my 'body count' since i was like 22, and most people knew it was gauche to ask by the time we were in college. i'm 31 now.
