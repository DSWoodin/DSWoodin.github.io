This is because we have advertised the task sequences to the unknown computer collections. Any machines that boot up and request task sequences that do not have a record in SCCM will be able to start running one of those advertised task sequences.<br/><br/>We are using non-integrated WDS which means we can’t use the unknown computer support on PXE service points. However, the issue here isn’t to do with unknown computer support anyway, it’s to do with known computers and task sequences not being available to them. That’s why we created the task sequence checker tool to add machines to the right collection at boot time.<br/><br/>Advertising task sequences without mandatory schedules to all machines is out of the question, it would take just one person to think “that task sequence didn’t run on that computer properly, I know I’ll right click and rerun on the advertisement” to rebuild every machine in the company! Obvious no no.
