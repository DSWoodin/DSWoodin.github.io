[[interviewing]]
 What are some smart questions to ask about the team/company to reveal any red flags? 
 
 "If there is one thing you could change about your team/work/company, what would it be". / Where do you think you can improve the most (as a company)?”
 
 How long have you worked here? If you are meeting any staff, ask this question. High turnover is a huge red flag.
 

What do you like about working here? 


How did your company respond to the covid-19 pandemic?

As a follow up, ask them what their WFH / remote work policy will be once the pandemic has subsided a bit

how many hours they worked last week and when did they take their last vacation. / “in past six months how many times the team or team members have to do overtime- includes weekends and after hours”

“What’s the biggest problem your team or company is facing?”

“How is success measured for a person in this position”

Your best research on a company is going to be conducted on former employees.

- How do you handle tight deadlines from clients? -- I've had someone nervously laugh and admit to 80 weeks before xmas. I followed up with 'how was that compensated', with an even more nervous laugh saying 'well we are all salaried here...'

- What do you do when a task was under estimated and wont be completed in this work cycle as expected? -- Pay attention to how its worded, but they might slip up and admit to expecting overtime. OT isnt necessarily bad depending on who you are, but what im looking for is specifically the expectation of it not being compensated.

- How do you handle version control and collaboration with your developers? -- There are some companies that dont use git still :0

- Do you do tests? -- not bad, but i like seeing if they will be honest about it. ill usually follow up with how they feel about the lack of testing.

- What is your usual onboarding procedure? -- some companies dont have one :0

- Is it ok to approve your own pull requests or do you require code review? - youd be suprised 

Joel test.

Extract info on turnover rate.

Median time manager and other team members have been there and also longest and shortest time. Same for other team’s members doing similar function to you there. Average is sensitive to outliers, just a quick median and average can give you a slight idea. If I had to choose one I’d take median. I’d rather be on a team where 5 people of equal rank have been there 5 years each /- 1 year averaging 5 years on the job, than a team where 4 people have been there less than 2 years each and one person has been there 19 years of the same rank. Average can hide this.

Get evidence of what the actual stack they are using is and if that’s the actual stack your team is using.

Get evidence of what your actual workstation will be.

Have them show you your actual desk (if not remote/WFH).

Extract when they paid their last bonus and how often they actually pay bonuses. Some companies (my employer) tout a big bonus but they haven’t managed to hit the marks for the last 10 years or something so no one ever actually got a bonus...

It's the weekend and a bug is reported in the live environment. What happens next?

Look for:

    do they recognize that some bugs can wait and others can't?

    are there people specifically on call to handle this (and paid accordingly) or is everyone expected to be able to immediately respond 24/7?
    
        If you could improve one major thing about the system architecture, what would it be?
    
        Are there plans in the works to fix that?
    
 “What do you like to do for fun in the evenings”
 
     Can you talk a bit about the diversity and inclusion statistics at your company?
     If they're not tracking, it shows that it's not really top of mind for them.
 
     Is the DEI lead a paid position or are you relying on employee volunteerism?
     Again, relying on employee volunteering for DEI on top of their regular duties mean diversity is an after-thought / performative act
 
     Can you talk about the funnest thing that a team did in the past month?
     Basic behavioral culture question to let you know if the team really gets together and have fun
 
     How have you adjusted for the challenges COVID presented to your team culture?
     Are they actively adjusting for the challenges that WFH presents?
 
     I also ask a bit about their hiring plans but usually via a sideway question involving what they plan for the team size to be in the next 6 months. Are they hiring other people besides me for the same team? If yes, that's a good sign for team health. Keep in mind that COVID has forced many companies to restructure their plans and priorities. It's more about how they prioritize the growth of the team you're joining as opposed to the overall health of the company.
 
 If speaking to your prospective manager:
 
     Can you speak a bit about the developer you most enjoyed managing, what about him or her made them a dream to manage?
     This gives key insights as to what your hiring manager values in a subordinate and leads to great talking points for you later on.
 
     What's the funnest thing the team engaged in the past month?
 
     What have been some challenges that are unique to your team?
 
     Can you talk about the last difficult conversation you had with a subordinate? How did you broach it, resolve it, and what did you wish you did differently?
     Fairly standard behavioral question but turned around on the manager.
 
     Can you talk a bit about the last 1:1 you had with a direct report? When was it, what were some of the topics you went over?
     Does your manager have frequent 1:1s? What do they talk about? Is this what you'd like your 1:1s to be?
 
 In speaking to a peer:
 
     Can you speak a bit about the developer you most enjoyed working with? What about him/her made them a dream to work with?
 
     What's the funnest thing you enjoyed doing at this company?
 
     What's a funny inside joke or prank your team engaged in?
 
     What's the process like for you in adjusting to COVID?
 
     During this difficult time, how would you evaluate your health insurance coverage?
     Mental and over all health coverage is important, does this place have good plans in place?
 
     What's the most challenging aspect of your work in the past 3 months?
 
     What is the user problem currently at top of mind for you?
     
 "How often do you deploy to production?"
 
 How long has your dev team been in place,
 
 
 how long has the longest employed dev been working here.
 
 
 In 3 to 4 years with the company where could i see myself?
 
 
 What do you see as the end goal for your product?
 
 
 Do you have on call employees, if so whats the rotation like, am i expected to be one, and what do you have in place for compensating on call employees.
 
 
 Is my manager a developer also, or are they strictly management? ( someone from outside your department will likely be harder to deal with)
 
 "Tell me about an idea from an employee that you've championed."
 
 If it's a programming job, "How much time do you spend on testing?"
 
 For an IT/Ops job, "What failsafe systems do you have in place in the case that your server room gets flooded by a fire system?"
 
 For a data/science job, "What is your sanity & ethics checklist when sourcing data/preparing to train a model?"
 
 My favorite question to ask is, “what could the company do to make your job easier? What do they fail at doing?”
 

 "How many people have you interviewed for this job so far".
 
 Well me why you rejected the previous two people you interviewed before me
 Can you walk me through a simulated code review and/or merge approval process?
 
 How many engineers do you have in senior management?
 
 What’s the process for performance reviews and promotions/raises?
 
 Oh- and if they promise to review your pay in x months- don’t take their word, get them to put it in your contract!
 
     What IDE do you use? Check with your programming language and preferences.
 
     What do you use for source control? Not git or Mercurial and no plan to transition? That's bad.
 
     What does a developer workstation look like? Do you have your choice of operating system, or is it Windows-only? Windows only is not a deal breaker, but if I have a choice between two jobs and the other allows me a Unix workstation, I'm probably going that direction.
 
     How old is your legacy codebase? What languages did you use prior to the current stack?
 
     Do you need a web front-end expert, and are you expecting it to be me? If the answer to those questions is yes, I thank them for their time and advise them that I am not the person they're looking for. (I don't want to work on front-end: I abhor everything to do with JavaScript and the DOM, and I barely know how to even spell those words. I mean, there's always a little need for it, but I will take effort to avoid that when possible.)
 
     How much average experience can I expect from the team? I do not want to be the most experienced person on a team. I'm firmly a mid-career developer, and while I'm starting to do the work of a senior, I'm not ready to be the seniormost developer on the team. I'm too young for that--I'm not in my 40's yet.
 
     What are your biggest technical hurdles? I want to know what management is saying no to.
 
     How's the coffee? If I went to an afternoon interview, I didn't drink it (because I want to go to sleep tonight).
     
     How do you reward loyal employees? After how much time?
     
     "Do you value clean code?" (yes) "What qualities do you consider good, clean code to have?"
     
         how many women, if any, are in your management chain? VPs? Execs? (1 is the highest number I've seen)
     
         how many people in your workgroup (6-30 ppl) have children?
     
         is the product date-driven or quality-driven? Both is not a valid answer without an unlimited budget.
     
         are people allowed to make mistakes here, or are all mistakes covered up and never talked about, never learned from?
     
         if you found a clever way to make your build ten times faster, would you tell 1. No one 2. Your friends/clique/workgroup 3. Everyone
     
         Pagers? OnCall? Travel? Workplace politics? Do you sell to the military, ICE, DHS?
     
         Stack ranking? (everyone says no) How do you attract high performers? (If their answer sounds like stack ranking, it is)
     
         Performance reviews? Are people graded/ranked on # of checkins, size of checkins, manager perceived importance of the work? (all of these are garbage, my last workplace had compulsive refactorers, pointless method/class name changes, endless meaningless little changes, just to look good in stack ranking)
     
         if a problem takes a long time to solve, whose fault is that, if any?
         
 I like to ask about team structure, tools, development practices, and what products they work on. I've asked things like why the last person left before and work-life balance questions.
 
 I want to hear about the dev environment and that they try to manage the chaos. I've had places admit to no process or having a dated dev environment (think VB 6 but at least we have it in SVN).
 
 Structures also kinda give a hint to where you might fit and how developed the organization is. Some places don't have QA or you'll be wearing 50 different hats trying to keep things from bursting into flames. Others might not let you do anything unless you fill out the right forms in triplicate.
 
 One of my favorite questions to ask is what sort of mistakes did you make and how did upper management handle that?
 
 what is the technical debt strategy?
 
 What is your design and documentation process?
 
 What team will I be on?
 
 What is the team structure?
 
 What is the experience in the team?
 
 Is my Line manager a tech or product person? Who is his boss?
 
 What tech will I be using?
 
 Will I be working in a greenfields or brownfield project?
 
 How easy is it to move to another team?
 
 Do you prefer to promote employees, or hire externally?
 
 What is the on-call schedule?
 
 How often are one on ones scheduled?
 
 About the product
 
 Whats your CI/CD process and tools?
 
 Do you have frontend and backend unit test, what is your unit test coverage?
 
 The company
 
 What Version control tool do you use?
 
 Is it ok to approve your own pull requests or do you require code review?
 
 What percentage of time is given to tech debt improvement?
 
 How many hours of learning and development are employees per week?
 
 What is the learning and development budget for employees?
 
 how many hours they worked last week and when did they take their last vacation?
 
 “in past six months how many times the team or team members have to do overtime- includes weekends and after hours”
 
 What do you do when a task was under estimated and wont be completed in this work cycle as expected?
 
 what’s the best thing about this company, what would you like to improve?
