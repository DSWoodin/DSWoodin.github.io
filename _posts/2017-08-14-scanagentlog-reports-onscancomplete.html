<h2>
ScanAgent.log reports OnScanComplete with error=0x87d00692</h2>
<br />
<i><b>Scenario</b></i>:<br />
<br />
Clients are not receiving Software Updates for both Microsoft OS updates and Windows Defender. &nbsp;The SCCM concole resports that the system does not summaries any required updates. We have a Group policy in place applying a specific update service location; this location is applied in several policies over several OU's. Only one policy when applied results in the error <b>0x87d00692</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>ScanAgent.log</b><br />
<br />
ScanJob({BAA53BE2-9FE1-48B6-89A7-0D60BC07ED50}): CScanJob::OnScanComplete -Scan Failed with Error=0x87d00692<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />
<br />
ScanJob({BAA53BE2-9FE1-48B6-89A7-0D60BC07ED50}): CScanJobManager::OnScanComplete- failed at CScanJob::OnScanComplete with error=0x87d00692<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>:</div>
<div>
We have a Group policy in place applying a specific update service location; this location is applied in several policies over several OU's. The single policy that was resulting in &nbsp;<b>0x87d00692 </b>has had the update service location removed and handed management over to the SCCM client. The error has been been removed from the log and the client updated almost instantly.</div>
