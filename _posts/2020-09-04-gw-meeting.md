Tian Haijun, Professor of China Three Gorges University, winner of the Hubei Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund, Selected Three Gorges Scholar (first level), visiting scholar of Johns Hopkins University in the United States and Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany. Research topics in recent years mainly include: stellar kinematics statistics, self-measurement, binary stars, Milky Way structure and evolution, etc. In 2015, the intrinsic velocity of the sun measured by LAMOST was included in the most important review journal "Astronomy and Astrophysics Annual Review" in the field of astronomy. In 2017 and 2020, the large-scale self-planetary tables GPS1 and GPS1+ (7 in total) The self-proportion of more than 100 million stars), has been cited as "best" or "very useful" from the planetary table many times in the world; the research results on double stars in 2020 were hailed as "reviewers' dream work" by anonymous reviewers In the same year, he was quoted by an invited article in the Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science. In recent years, he has presided over four projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (including one China-Europe Talent Project), jointly undertook one national key fund, and presided over one key fund of Hubei Province.
