_Oasis_, for those readers who don't know, is the cultural festival organized by the student community at BITS, Pilani, held in the month of October or November. _Oasis 2017_ was held this week at Pilani, and I have never missed Pilani and its people more than I did this week. This came as weird shock to me, considering I have never liked Oasis, and have even critiqued it quite vocally for its many faults. I think these periodic shocks are pretty amazing ways to identify what matters to you the most. True, I hated Oasis, but I realized I was in love with the idea of it - four complete days of being with people most special to me, and creating memories. Also, memories, dear reader, are bitches.

But I don't really feel like ruminating all my Pilani related thoughts today. So, very conveniently, I managed to stumble on a poem I had written in 2009. I wrote it as an entry for my school magazine, and my cousin also plagiarized it in her school magazine. Anyway, this is probably the only poem written in my school days I am still in possession of.

You might think the poem would be an early teenager's angst about society. No, it wasn't! It was a hagiographic poem about Barack Obama. I still do not recollect why I chose Obama as my subject; maybe I will remember it someday. Given below, is the full-text of the poem, unedited. Please take a moment to smile at my forced rhymes, and stupid poetry.


#Barack Hussein Obama

O America, a wonderful gift you have got  
A person, vibrant, challenging and hot  
Known by people near and far  
By the person of Barack Hussein Obama.

Though an African-American you are  
'Change' you will bring to the world  
You indeed have becpome a star  
With steps humble and pearled.

Through all barriers boldly you stood  
Undergoing troubled times, bitter and rude  
You showed the world through pure simplicity  
'Change' you will be in the world for good.

O Obama, it's now that you say  
Arise, O America, call it a day  
Bring joy to the shattered  
And hope to the hopeless  
Love to the lonely  
And employment for the jobless  
Enrich other countries to build a new world  
Where joy will never cease  
And all around will be pure peace.

May your agenda be to help  
Fight poverty and terrorism  
To let the poor and weak countries grow  
And bridge nations with peace and harmony  
Build bridges over troubled lands  
And in friendship join friendly hands.
