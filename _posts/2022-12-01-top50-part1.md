Back in 2020 I decided to do a top 25 games as a countdown to [Jul](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jule%C3%B8l) over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CId2t18hw-e/). That was a fun experiment. This year I've decided to revisit it in a more... scientific manner. 

## Methodology

I copied the names of all the games I've ranked 9.0 or higher at BGG and fed them into the [ranking engine of the PubMeeple](https://www.pubmeeple.com/ranking-engine). For those unfamiliar with this fabulous tool, it basically takes any list of things you want to rank and propose them in one-on-one battles for you to pick a favourite. It keeps doing this until it can rank them all. This is an interesting way to get a snapshot of one's taste at any moment. But, also, excruciatingly hard. I tried to think of ideal scenarios for each of the games in question -- player count, play time, expansions, ... -- and answer with that in mind.

So, lo and behold, an estimated 169 comparisons later, the list was ready.

## General Comments

- Last time I did this I only ranked my top 25 games, so, obviously there are lots of games flagged as "N/A"s. "NEW" are games that are new to me since last time I made this list (2020).
- There has been a lot of turbulence here -- possibly a lot to do with the above mentioned methodology change.
- This is very much a snapshot of my taste just now. Tonight. Tomorrow it will be different. Probably. A bit. (Not that I'll update it. (Not until next year, at least...))
- _All_ of these games are absolutely amazing.

## 42-50

| Rank  | Item | Change |
|---:|:---|:---:|
| 42 | Terramara (2019) | N/A |
| 43 | The Crew: Mission Sous-Marine (2021) | NEW |
| 44 | 7 Wonders Duel (2015) | ↓20 |
| 45 | Ecos: Continent Originel (2020) | NEW |
| 46 | Russian Railroads (2013) | N/A |
| 47 | Suburbia (2013) | ↓25 |
| 48 | San Juan (2004) | N/A |
| 49 | Dominion (2008) | N/A |
| 50 | Splendor (2014) | N/A |

I was surprised to see how **7 Wonders Duel** and **Suburbia** dropped like stones in this ranking. Of course there are lots of really, really great games higher on the list, but still. For Suburbia it _probably_ has something to do with the fact that I haven't really _played_ it for years... 7WD, though... Not sure. I guess I just like the games higher up better...

## 33-41

| Rank  | Item | Change |
|---:|:---|:---:|
| 33 | Wingspan (2019) | N/A |
| 34 | Paleo (2021) | NEW |
| 35 | Caverna: The Cave Farmers (2013) | N/A |
| 36 | It's a Wonderful Kingdom (2021) | NEW |
| 37 | Go (-2200) | ↓23 |
| 38 | Everdell (2018) | NEW |
| 39 | Evolution: Climate (2016) | N/A |
| 40 | Puerto Rico (2002) | ↓17 |
| 41 | Les Petites Bourgades (2019) | N/A |

This part of the list has the first of my most recent _coup de coeurs_ -- **Paleo**. Great, great coop game. Both of the games dropping on this list -- **Go** and **Puerto Rico** -- has a lot to do with the fact that I haven't played them for years. (Spoiler alert: I'll get back to Puerto Rico later in this countdown...)

## 25-32

| Rank  | Item | Change |
|---:|:---|:---:|
| 25 | Terra Mystica (2012) | N/A |
| 26 | Underwater Cities (2018) | NEW |
| 27 | Dune: Imperium (2020) | NEW |
| 28 | Expedition to Newdale (2020) | NEW |
| 29 | Viticulture (2014) | ↓12 |
| 30 | Cascadia (2021) | NEW |
| 31 | Heat (2022) | NEW |
| 32 | Welcome to the Moon (2021) | NEW |

**HEAT** is the another recent huge post-summer hit in the household. The big surprise drop here is **Viticulture**. I don't get to play it _that_ often, and that is probably part of the reason, but I _did_ play a great round of it a couple of months ago... Well... This is the way.

Ah, and the [cover image](/assets/img/posts/2022-top50/100-latest.jpg) for this post is a collage I made of my 100 last _played_ games using the ever so handy [BG Stats app](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/).
