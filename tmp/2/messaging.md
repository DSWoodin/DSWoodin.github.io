## story
- first sales hire under the ceo and cofounder (good friend) in sept 2013
- went to market and run the full sales process (sourcing, closing and managing) any and all deals (spray and pray-- didn't know where the money was coming from)
- managed first class of sales folks and helped operationalize our current model based on predictive revenue from sfdc (leadgen, closer, farmer)
- as the top performer, the company needed me to focus on closing
- made a bunch of money selling bigger deals (medieval times, equinox, walmart)
- company wasn't ready for it and had to take on more of a farming role and i'm a salesman at the end of the day
- left around september, took break, had a lot of fun, and now i'm excited to get back at it

I would love to connect with you sooner to get your insights on the SalesOps function in general and possibly identify opportunities around the city. I know I could learn so much from you, and I would really value your advice and knowledge here.
