Backlogs are not linear lists. Iâ€™m a big fan of story maps, which are 2 dimensional. Often, there are several stories that are equally valuable, but in different product areas. Teams can pull the ones that fit their skillsets best. If one is clearly higher priority, tho, do that.

Try limiting the backlog size to 4 weeks work or less. Nothing goes on unless something comes off.

Instead of estimating size, you can get all of this and more by focusing on narrowing. Make stories smaller and smaller until your gut tells you you can do it in a day or two max. That always uncovers low value work hiding in the too-large story.
