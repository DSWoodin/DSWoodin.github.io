Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics, under the supervision of *[Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/)* and *[Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/)*. I am part of the [HeKA Team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/).

I work on applying shape analysis tools to fetal brain MRIs to characterize developmental anomalies during pregnancy.

My research topics include:

- **Riemanian Geometry;**
- **Image registration;**
- **MRI processing.**
