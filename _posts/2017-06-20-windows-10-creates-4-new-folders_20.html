<b>Scenario</b>: On the root of the C drive you right click and select New "Folder". &nbsp;Windows will then create 4 New folder i.e. New Folder, New Folder (2), New Folder (3), New Folder (4). &nbsp;To delete or open these folders you need to elevate permissions on each one.<br /><br />We have seen this issue only occur on Windows 10 systems applying Group Policy.<br /><br /><b>Cause: </b>In our environment a specific Group policy was filtered to Windows 10 only. &nbsp;Within this policy the following security setting was set to modify C: drive file permissions:<br /><br />Computer&gt; Policies&gt; Windows Settings&gt;File System<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wPWCNzmgBH0/WUkJblAd-JI/AAAAAAAABSE/FgbMT79TKRk13Fqx14P1vso6BNqiKey2wCLcBGAs/s1600/FileSystem-4Folders.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="656" data-original-width="1364" height="190" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wPWCNzmgBH0/WUkJblAd-JI/AAAAAAAABSE/FgbMT79TKRk13Fqx14P1vso6BNqiKey2wCLcBGAs/s400/FileSystem-4Folders.png" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The policy specifically was allowing Administrators Full Control and Users Read and Execute permissions to "<b>This Folder" only</b>. &nbsp;This had the affect of preventing sub-folders from &nbsp;inheriting Administrator / Users permissions.<br /><br />If this policy does not exist or is set to "This folder, Sub-folders, and files" then the additional Folders are not created.<br /><br />I believe this issue is a bug in the way Windows attempt to create the folder and inherit permissions; by default the folder will inherit from above but with this policy in place it fails to inherit and tries 4 times before timing out. &nbsp;Each attempt results in a restricted folder.<br /><br /><br /><br />
