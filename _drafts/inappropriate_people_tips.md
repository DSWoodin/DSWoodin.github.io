 I worked for a strong woman in a high position where we were both subjected to tasteless male commentary. 

One of the first things she taught me, aside from a strong handshake, was that when a man says something inappropriate you stare into their eyes with a straight face and give it “two beats” - two heart beats - and, if applicable, ask “what makes you say that?”

They literally shrivel. Every time. I am so grateful to her. She taught me a lot of important lessons about taking zero shit from men.
