Poster Lottery Terms

The Fur Squared poster is happening!&nbsp; Here’s how you get in: When you register for Fur Squared 2023, there will be a checkbox and a link to this document.&nbsp; Read the entire document, and check the box to acknowledge your entry into the 2023 poster raffle.

Entry into the lottery will last until Sunday, February 11 at 11:59pm central.&nbsp; Assuming there are more than 50 people interested in the poster tier, 50 random people will be picked, and announced on Monday, February 13.&nbsp; On that date, emails with special registration upgrade links will be sent out.&nbsp; The price for the Poster tier is $200.&nbsp; Your cost will be the difference between that and what you paid for your existing badge.

If you do not complete your upgrade and payment by Sunday, January 16 at 11:59pm central, we will go to the next name in a randomized standby list, and will continue to do so until all poster slots are filled.If you miss your chance, we’re sorry, but that will be final!
