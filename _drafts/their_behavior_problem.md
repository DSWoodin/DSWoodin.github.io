 Well, the thing is, women are told to blame themselves for "attracting the wrong men," as if wrong men are grizzly bears and women are out in the wilderness using poor camping food storage techniques.

But the fact is, psychotically thirsty guys are everywhere. And they're not just singling you out. They are trying their pushy, entitled ways on every woman they talk to. For all you know, the two guys trying to blow up your phone were blowing up someone else's phone 2 weeks ago, and they will be blowing up yet someone else's phone 2 weeks from now. Their behavior is the problem, not your mental state.
