[Outward order can help inward calm](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/61742418-outer-order-inner-calm). I've heard something like that before and for me, it’s been certainly mostly true through the years. I mean, there is and will always be a level of chaos I have to accept here with littles every day, but there are some routines that really help to [simplify our home life](https://www.simplehomemom.com/10-simple-habits-to-create-a-simpler-home/). Today on the blog, I'm sharing about 5 key routines to help simplify your home life (and that may help towards more inward calm too!).

## 5 key routines to help simplify your home life

1. **Laundry.** I have multiple [blogs on laundry](https://www.simplehomemom.com/tags/#laundry%20routine) because it's been a huge routine we’ve simplified in our home over the years as our family grew. You can listen to me talking about it as well as lots of tips on [this podcast](https://www.minimalistmomspodcast.com/ep155-simplify-your-laundry-routine-with-kelly-briggs/) and read [the blog on simplifying laundry for busy families](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-keep-your-laundry-routine-simple-for-busy-families/) that is helpful as well.
2. **Dishes.** Dishes are every day whether you have a bustling household like me or you are just by yourself. Simplifying the dishes’ routine can help simplify your home life so much. There will always be dishes, but having a routine will help to keep things flowing. See [my blog on kitchen explosions](https://www.simplehomemom.com/four-ideas-to-go-from-kitchen-explosions-to-clear-counters/) for more on that. 
3. [**Bedtime**](https://www.simplehomemom.com/setting-boundaries-around-bedtime-routines/)**.** Ooof. This was an area we majorly needed to work on in the past. My husband and I like to take our time, but bedtime needed to be much quicker and simpler. You can read my blog on it [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/setting-boundaries-around-bedtime-routines/). Simplifying bedtimes can help lead to more calm in your home. It's a marathon and a noise machine hour ish for us often, but the kids at least know what to expect now. Anything helps, right?!
4. **Meals.** Simplifying meal planning and meal routines is so key in simplifying your home life. I'm in the midst of revamping all things in this area, including an upcoming launch of my Simple Meal Planning Guide. Simple meal planning and routines can help simplify your home life so much. I often have [hangry children](https://www.simplehomemom.com/three-tips-to-feed-the/) around meal time, so when I'm not on the ball, it can be a disaster ha.
5. **Morning routine.** Whether you’re a stay at home parent or working outside the home parent, having a morning routine for yourself and the whole family is so helpful in starting the day a lot smoother.
