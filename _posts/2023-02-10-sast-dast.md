Have you ever heard of SAST and DAST security tests? Well, these tests are essential for ensuring the security of web applications. As the web continues to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, the security of web applications has become a critical concern for both businesses and consumers alike. The consequences of a security breach can be far-reaching, from financial losses and reputational damage to sensitive data being stolen or leaked.

Some common risks of security breachs include: 

1. Data breaches - theft or unauthorized access to sensitive information such as personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.

2. Authentication and access control vulnerabilities - weaknesses in user authentication and authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to sensitive information or allow attackers to escalate privileges.

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - attacker-controlled scripts can be injected into a web page and executed by unsuspecting users. This can lead to theft of sensitive information, such as passwords and cookies, or allow attackers to take over the user's session.

4. SQL Injection - attackers can inject malicious SQL code into an application, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or allow the attacker to manipulate or delete data.

5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - attackers can trick users into making unintended requests to a web application. This can lead to unauthorized transactions, such as changing passwords or making unauthorized purchases.

6. Remote Code Execution (RCE) - attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to execute arbitrary code on the server, giving them full control over the affected system.

To mitigate these risks, it's important to implement robust security testing practices. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) is a type of security testing that analyzes source code for vulnerabilities before the application is deployed. On the other hand, DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is a type of security testing that tests the application for vulnerabilities during runtime.

**Advantages of SAST:**

Early detection: By identifying security issues early in the development process, SAST makes it possible to fix vulnerabilities before the application is deployed, reducing the risk of a security breach.

Automated: SAST tools are typically automated, making it possible to test the security of large applications in a relatively short period of time.

Cost-effective: SAST is a cost-effective way to test the security of your applications, as it can be done without any interaction with the runtime environment.

**Advantages of DAST:**

Real-world testing: By testing the behavior of a web application during runtime, DAST provides a more realistic representation of the security of your application.

Identifies runtime vulnerabilities: Unlike SAST, which focuses on source code, DAST is able to identify security vulnerabilities that may only be present during runtime.

Complements SAST: DAST and SAST complement each other, providing a more comprehensive view of the security of your web applications.

**Implementing a Good Security Testing Program on Azure DevOps:**

Now, how do we implement these tests in an Azure DevOps pipeline? Let's say we have a C# web application that we want to secure. The first step would be to set up a build pipeline in Azure DevOps. This build pipeline would contain a task that would run a SAST tool, such as Roslyn Security Guard or SonarQube, to analyze the application's source code for any security vulnerabilities.

Once the build pipeline is complete, we can move on to the release pipeline. In this pipeline, we would include a task to run a DAST tool, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, to test the application for vulnerabilities during runtime. These tools simulate an attacker trying to exploit the application and report any vulnerabilities found.

By integrating SAST and DAST tests into our Azure DevOps pipeline, we can ensure that security is a part of the development process from the start. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities from being introduced into the application, as well as identify and remediate any existing vulnerabilities. In the end, this leads to a more secure and trustworthy application.

Monitor results: Make sure you monitor the results of your security tests and act on any issues that are identified. This may involve fixing vulnerabilities or updating your security tests to cover new threats.

Continuously improve: Security is an ongoing process, and it's important to continuously improve your security testing program. This may involve integrating new tools, updating existing tests, or adjusting your testing process.

Security testing is an essential!
