 If you're ever in Berlin, do all the touristy stuff in one day. Go to the Reichstag and walk to the Brandenburger Tor, visit the Holocaust Memorial, then walk to the Alexanderplatz. There's not *that* much to see but that city has so much more cool places to visit or to hang out. Especially if you're looking to meet people or not pay much for little value.
