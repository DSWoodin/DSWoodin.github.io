Some people dream of creating an useful app. It’s the best when app solves some social problems - communication in the city, monitoring of air quality, ecology, poverty or others. I prepared for you tools pack which help you realise your plan. Some tools can be trivial but from my perspective, a lot of people forgot this and project fail with a bad setup as a reason.

### Slack
Communication in open source project is most important things. You don’t need to be online every time, but you must have specified communication channel with your partners. Dispersion in communication (use Facebook Messenger and Slack and phone and SMS) generate a lot of problems - inaccuracies, wrong interpretation requests, a leak of process change something.
 
### GitHub
Github is most famous service to maintain open source projects, but if you decide to use another - no problem. Please remember about correct licenses and licenses tools and libraries which you will use into the project.

### Trello or any simple “task manager”
Please remember about task manager. It makes development process simpler and more clarified. Developers, designers and rest of partners have a simple information what is todo, what is in progress, and who work on the specified task - it’s part of communication process.

### Canva
It’s the simple tool to generate some images for social media and others - formats, filters, styles.

### Pexels.com or any free stock images portal
Huge hub with free beautiful photos for social media or any your project case.

### Facebook Pages - mobile app
All project in nowadays needs fan page in Facebook. Facebook Page application helps you manage page and separate your private profile and your project site. Next reason is creating a communication channel between you and users. 

### Heroku
The huge part of open source projects needs hosting. The best situation when hosting is easy to maintain and no need DevOps. My recommendation is Heroku, it’s free, simple, clarify UI and has nice integration with Github. Next reason is - nontechnical people can quickly understand this tool.

### Buy me a coffee, zrzutka.pl or any other confounding service
If you need some money to provide your project please use this tools. Nothing else :D People who believe the intention of your project gives you some money. Go ahead!
