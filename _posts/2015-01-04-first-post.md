I really like the PyZillow python wrapper for Zillow's API. Makes it seamless to pull Zillow data straight into Python with a few simple functions. Here is a way to be able to pull rent zestimate data.

**Step 1:** Download the pyzillow.py file from here:

![Download the updated pyzillow file here](./)

**Step 2:** Replace it with the old pyzillow.py. I would save the older version and put it in an archive folder, just in case. If you need helping the pyzillow.py file, run this command:
>pyzillow?
