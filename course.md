_The Simplify Your Life At Home: a course for busy moms_ is a six week interactive course.

Launch date TBD (late October).

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This is NOT a one size fits all course. It’s also not a one-time solution course as I believe that life is a LIFELONG process of learning and growing. I will promise you, however, that this course will be packed with things you can learn and grow with today and going forward. There will be some things that stick and make you think, some things that may not apply, but you’ll still be able to learn from them. I'm not an expert, but I have life experience as a mom of four, and journeying along the road to simplifying. I’m just like you, wading through finding myself over the years at home. Welcome to the Simplify Your Life At Home: a course for busy moms. I’m so happy to have you here to check this course out to see if it would be good for you!
