title: Destiny 2 Season of Dawn Weapons Retrospective
subtitle: Asking and answering the important question of why the best weapons were the best
---

When it comes to answering the question of "What's the best gun in Destiny 2 for PvP?" answering that question is fairly easy. All you need to do is head over to [Destiny Tracker's Insights page](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights) and see what the most used guns are, and those are probably the best. Answering the question of *why*, however, can be somewhat difficult, as there are a multitude of ways one weapon can hold an edge over another. From varying stats, differing time-to-kill (TTK) values between sub-types, different perk pools, or, in the case of exotic weapons, special abilities, these are just a few ways some weapons can rise in use amongst so many choices.
