 Dudes have little to no emotional fortitude.  My dad is currently trying every which way (and has since March) to get me to move back in with him, because he cannot stand being quarantined.  Men are used to dumping their difficult emotions on the women in their lives, by starting fights/arguments or just relying on them for comfort.  Since my dad is divorced that means he's now alone and forced to spend time by himself and he cannot stand it.  The drama with him has been nonstop since March.  It's just another symptom of this same thing- men really cannot stand situations where they are forced the deal with their own emotions
