 Oh my god my mom is also the nicest person in the world but she completely disowned me for a week after her dog died! I can't even remember what the reason was. 

She is absolutely TERRIBLE with handling grief. It's not uncommon for someone to outwardly project their feelings on someone alive than for them to project them towards the unchangeable death. 

She doesn't do it on purpose but she needs to create problems outside of her grief so she feels like she is in control of her feelings.
