For enterprises, Windows 8.1 delivers the control around the Start Screen 
that should have been there in Windows 8.0, there’s still no programmatic way to 
pin or unpin shortcuts from the Start Screen.<br />
<br />
Windows 8.1 introduces a 
Group Policy method for distributing a Start Screen layout, but that’s a policy 
– i.e. it’s enforced&nbsp;that approach only makes 
sense in specific cases (e.g. schools, kiosks etc.). Note that Start Screen 
control is only available in Windows 8.1 Enterprise and Windows RT 
8.1<br />
<br />
Microsoft have an article available on TechNet that describes a 
number of ways that you can configure the default Start Screen experience that 
will work for Windows 8/8.1, Window Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2, but 
the choices are:<br />
1.Create a reference image and use the CopyProfile setting 
in unattend.xml to customise the default profile including the Start 
Screen<br />
2.Use the StartTiles setting in unattend.xml to specify a list of 
tiles to add to the Start Screen<br />
3.Use SysPrep to generate 
AppsFolderLayout.bin and then copy that to the default profile<br />
<br />
I suggest 
you use the Powershell cmdlets that provides a way of getting your custom Start 
Screen layout into the default profile. These works for all edition of Windows 
8.1.<br />
<br />
This approach is really about customising the default Start Screen 
experience (i.e. first logon). If you want control of the Start Screen (users 
receive the same screen every session) you will need Windows 8.1 Enterprise or 
Windows Server 2012 R2. You can use this method to customise a reference image, 
an unattended deployment.<br />
<br />
High level overview:<br />
1.Deploy and/or log 
onto a machine that has the applications that you want to pin to the Start 
Screen<br />
2.Customise that Start Screen to your heart’s content<br />
3.Export 
the Start Screen configuration with Export-StartLayout<br />
4.Import the Start 
Screen configuration with Import-StartLayout<br />
<br />
To Export the Start Screen 
layout in binary format, (Import-StartLayout won’t import XML files) see 
Export-StartLayout command below:</div>
<br />
<div>
Export-StartLayout -As BIN -Path CustomStartScreenLayout.bin -Verbose</div>
<br />
<div>
The documentation for Import-StartLayout indicates that this cmdlet only 
works against offline images (mounted with ImageX); however the cmdlet can be 
run against the current Windows installation which is ideal for MDT task 
sequence deployment. The following command will import the customisation into 
the default profile of the local system. This will need to be run from an 
elevated command prompt.</div>
<br />
<div>
Import-StartLayout -LayoutPath .\Basic.bin -MountPath c:\</div>
