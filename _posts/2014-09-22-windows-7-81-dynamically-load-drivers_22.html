Windows 7 / 8.1 : Dynamically load drivers in a SCCM 2012 task sequence with Nomad<br /><br /><br />Overview: Within your organisation you have many different types of computer models.&nbsp; You want a single build task sequence that can dynamically select the correct driver package to install with the OS.<br /><br /><br />The Answer: To achieve the dynamic selection it is necessary to implement a MDT 2013 database (supply link) in which the Task Sequence will gather the assigned PackageID based on a Model type WMI query.<br /><br /><br />With this Task Sequence variable %OSDDRIVERPACKAGE% it is possible to use a command line to run an election and locate the PackageID within the local subnet.<br /><br /><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>NomadPackageLocator.exe -Nomad_local -RemoveHTTPLocations -RequireNomad -HideErrorDialog -RestrictPackages=%OSDDRIVERPACKAGE%</strong><br /><br /><br />Then as a follow up step the use of SMSNomad.exe prestage command will query the DP for the package and then download the Package from the winner of the election<br /><br /><br /><strong>SMSNomad.exe --s --Prestage --pp=http://%SMSDP%/SMS_PP_SMSPKG$/%OSDDRIVERPACKAGE%</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong><em>More details surrounding the database creation, Single Site Store, and things to watch out for in the log to follow.&nbsp; Use the comment field if you wish me to expand on any particular point.</em></strong><br /><br />
