[[self_care]]
Lockdown has taught me that I had zero understanding of what proper boundaries looked like for myself. I’ve spent so much time trying to fit in an extroverted world that I not only lost who I was but hindered any growth I could be having as a result. I finally started to learn boundaries and re-evaluating my life. A lot of regret but also a lot of excitement and realization that I do get to decide how I live my life, not other people. I’ve lost some relationships along the way, especially from those who benefitted from my not having any boundaries, but it made me feel weightless for the first time in forever and finally get a real sense on not just who I really am at my core but who I want to be. It’s shown me that life is in fact incredibly short and I don’t need to be wasting it on people who aren’t worth it. I’m forever a work in progress but at least now I feel like I can actually live my life true to myself, flawed and all, and have an even stronger bond with and appreciation for those who truly matter in my life and knew who I was before I even did.
