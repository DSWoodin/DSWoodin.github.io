 Great initiative. Thank you for doing this. I would also like to add ERE ([http://earlyretirementextreme.com/](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/)), which started *it all in USA*. MMM ([https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)) is a "non extreme" version of ERE. I will at some point write a post on why I think ERE approach is super useful for low income countries like India. I would like to go one more step further and say that ERE is much closer to Indian value system and would be easier for us to accept or follow.

A useful post from ERE: [http://earlyretirementextreme.com/cash-flow-diagrams-for-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-investor-class.html](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/cash-flow-diagrams-for-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-investor-class.html). One can find a lot of useful posts if they are willing to dig a little deeper in that site.
