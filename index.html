With 20+ years of experience in machine learning in both industry and academia, my roles varied from a Software Developer, Lead Applications Developer, IT Consultant, Research Staff and Senior Lecturer. One element that stayed constant is <b>Public Speaking</b> and <i>“getting the message delivered”</i>.

I'm currently the Developer Advocate at Hazelcast. I love creating content, delivering it, and hearing any feedback on my talks and presentations. I’m passionate about helping developers' communities get the most out of their software tools and applications. I share my talks on my YouTube channel, feel free to subscribe or follow to get the latest of my talks, or check my GitHub for some demo ideas I use in my presentations.
