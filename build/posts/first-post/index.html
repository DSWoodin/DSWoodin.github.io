    <p><strong>Inflationary Money Vs Deflationary Money</strong></p>
<p>This post is to highlight some talk-points from Pomp's Talk with Mark Moss in &quot;The True Innovation Behind Bitcoin Will Shock You&quot;.</p>
<p>If you're an investor you will know that inflation is just tax (on working people), without representation. I say working people, because anyone not working has figured out how the game works well enough to avoid most taxes.</p>
<p>People against deflationary systems almost always argue that the deflation will kill economic growth. They don't know this of course, because no true 100% deflationary supply capped money has ever existed, before bitcoin. The closest we've ever had was gold - of which there are numerous ways to 'alter' the supply or demand of it.</p>
<p>Here's what we know for a fact (because it as happened). Inflating a currency is at best just an incentive for people to get rid of their cash.</p>
<p>&quot;Invest it, consume, whatever - just get rid of it!&quot; - Your loving Goverment.</p>
<p>FIAT money's (USD, GBP etc) value literally burns away to nothing and because financial education is not encouraged or provided by the state, people naturally chose consume. Over time, this leads to manufacturers producing goods of declining quality with people still willing to buy them. We've seen this with 'skrinkflation' of our food goods. We've seen (or not seen) that big business have swapped out ingredients from their products for dangerous or harmful ingredients just to save money. Causing us plebs to consume even more, in health-care, meds etc. Don't even get me started on the medical industry's model for creating demand by causing side affects with one pill to be 'fixed' by the next. Clothing is another decline of quality. Sorry for all you women looking for non-transparent clothing. Men are recently losing their pockets in jeans too. Guess you'll just have to buy a handbag too, lads. Year on year you're paying more for less.</p>
<p>Now on the contrary, if you had a deflationary system - whereby any money not spent today is worth more tomorrow...Do you think we might arrive at a place where money is only spent on quality items?</p>
<p>Governments argue that inflation is used because we need encouragement to spend money. If this was the case, how is it that so many people aren't even aware of inflation? Some have a vague idea that prices go up each year but very few think about &quot;why?&quot;. Besides, we don't need encouragement to buy nice things. Come off it.</p>
<p>Another argument for inflation is that the credit markets are tied to it. Meaning that economies/countries can expand faster by borrowing now and paying later.  We know from experience that this speed causes boom and bust cycles for our countries. We don't know what life would be like under a fixed monetary supply system such as bitcoin but maybe economies would expand slower but with more stability.</p>
