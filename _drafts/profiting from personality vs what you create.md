I want to profit off what I create, not what I think or my personality. There's nothing wrong with using those to help you get places, but if they're the only things you're making money off, you put yourself in real danger of mental darwinism to select only the most profitable 'version' of who you are... and that's an incredibly dangerous place to be, because it can both really inhibit your opportunity to grow and cause you to become pidgeonholed into this corner, as you say.
