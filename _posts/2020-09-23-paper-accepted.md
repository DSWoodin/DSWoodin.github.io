The integration of mobile health (mHealth) devices into behavioral health research has fundamentally
changed the way researchers and interventionalists are able to collect data as well as deploy and 
evaluate intervention strategies. In these studies, researchers often collect intensive longitudinal 
data (ILD) using ecological momentary assessment methods, which aim to capture psychological, 
emotional, and environmental factors that may relate to a behavioral outcome in near real-time.
In order to investigate ILD collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation study, we propose
a Bayesian variable selection approach for time-varying effect models, designed to identify dynamic 
relations between potential risk factors and smoking behaviors in the critical moments around a quit attempt. 
We use parameter-expansion and data-augmentation techniques to efficiently explore how the underlying structure 
of these relations varies over time and across subjects. We achieve deeper insights into these relations by 
introducing nonparametric priors for regression coefficients that cluster similar effects for risk factors 
while simultaneously determining their inclusion. Results indicate that our approach is well-positioned to 
help researchers effectively evaluate, design, and deliver tailored intervention strategies in the critical 
moments surrounding a quit attempt.
