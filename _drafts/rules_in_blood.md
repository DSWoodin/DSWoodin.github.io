**themightyglamazon:**

I enforce federal worker health and safety and pollution regulations.  
  
When i was learning my trade, when my classmates and were having a chuckle over the "well duh" level of specificity written into the Code of Federal Regulations (try "no hazardous material shall be stored in crew berthing" on for size), I Will never forget the silence that followed when our instructor these words:   
  
"Your regulations are written in blood."
   
These regulations were not written on a whim. They were written because someone thought they could cut costs by storing however many more pounds of a radioactive: toxic, carcinogenic, or whatever else material in the same rooms where the human beings they paid to transport those materials slept and then *did that*, because no one was telling them not to.  
  
They were written because people died. Horrifically. Because unregulated capitalism values profit over human life and suffering.
  
Can I say it again, for those not paying attention?  
  
**Unregulated capitalism values profit over human life and suffering.**
