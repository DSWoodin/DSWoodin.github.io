Hello, Iâ€™m Musa ðŸ‘‹ 
a Software Developer specialized in iOS Development 
based in Munich.

Developing mobile apps is a passion that extends beyond my professional life. I read, sometimes write, and work on side projects in my free time. I simply enjoy being productive.

Different from my profession, there are other things that connect me to life. I write, not only technical stuff, but also ordinary things in daily life. I enjoy wandering in the city, going for hikes, cycling, and swimming.

<!-- ### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
