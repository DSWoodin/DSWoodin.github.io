I'm glad to welcome you to my personal website. It has been a long time since I wanted to have a modest blog where I could introduce myself, share my thoughts/knowledge, and showcase my work. Here, you will find three things: a page with short information about me, the projects I've worked on, and my occasional blog posts.

Hope you will visit soon again and find some valuable content. 
Bests,
Musa
