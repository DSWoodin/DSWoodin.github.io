### &nbsp;

### What's different this year?

We're virtual\! We're online\! We **WILL NOT** be at the hotel (please don't show up there). Instead, panels will be streamed online for all to watch\! Additionally, the virtual format gives us the option for a new type of programming: prerecorded panels\!

### What's a prerecorded panel?

A prerecorded panel is a panel that you will film and edit prior to the convention, and that will then be aired in its entirety. The final version of your prerecorded panel will need to be submitted no later than Friday, January 15, but once your panel is approved you can submit any version you're happy with and our programming staff will be able to offer feedback or suggestions.

### How much editing will Fur Squared do for me?

Unfortunately, Fur Squared doesn't have the resources to do any editing on prerecorded panels more involved than minor runtime adjustments.

### Will I need VRChat to watch panels?

*No, you will not need VRChat to watch panels*. Panels will be streamed via popular online streaming services (such as YouTube or Twitch) embedded on our website and available for everyone with Internet access to watch.

### Why do panels have weird times this year?

This year we're asking panelists to end their panels 10 minutes earlier than normal. This will allow us to have theming, charity, or other miscellaneous content between panels, as well as provide a cushion in case we experience technical difficulties.

### What about gaming tournaments or TTRPG games?

Given the virtual nature of this year's con, we want to include expanded video and tabletop gaming tracks. Such events will likely be relegated to a Secondary Events programming track. Secondary events will be hosted by members of the community and listed on our schedule, and we will point attendees to your stream, channel, etc. Please submit events of this category to the regular programming submissions form linked on this page.

### When will I hear back about my submission?

You should have already heard back\! If you haven't, please reach out to [programming@fursquared.com](mailto:programming@fursquared.com).
