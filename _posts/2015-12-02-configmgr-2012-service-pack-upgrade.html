ConfigMgr 2012 Service Pack Upgrade<br />
(SCCM 2012 R2 SP1 upgrade)<br />
<br />
I was performing the initial Test Database command from the SMSSETUP\BIN\X64 directory of the installation media run the following command:<br />
(Setup.exe /testdbupgrade &lt;database_name&gt; )<br />
<br />
Once the Pre-requistite check runs it references 'Unsupported ConfigMgr database version' and log states 'Failed to connect to SQL Server to verify site version'.<br />
If you search else where you may think this is a permissions based issue (definately check) but in my case this was not the case and i knew the database was supported.<br />

ERROR: Failed to connect to SQL Server to verify site version.<br />
Unsupported ConfigMgr database version; &nbsp; &nbsp;Error; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the site database upgrade to succeed, the database version must be Configuration Manager 2012 R2 or later.<br />

Resolution: It was an issue in the Syntax on the command line. It is quite common for the database name to resemble CM_P01 or CM_P02 etc. &nbsp;However, in this case it was CM_PO1 and CM_P02 etc.<br />
If you look closely there is a difference. &nbsp;Check whether its a ZERO (0) or a letter O<br />
