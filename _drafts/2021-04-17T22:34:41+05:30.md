As well as once the exhaustion and fatigue set in, which we all know makes people grumpy, we don't want to do anything or be near anyone. We want solitude, peace, and sleep. 

We get none of it... instead we get a thousand questions as to why we're so grumpy and never want to go anywhere, once again reassuring we won't get that peace. 

By the time we have had enough sacrifice and throw caution to the wind and vow to have some real fun, something breaks or a family member needs help.. it never ends. We keep pushing back our hopes and dreams for that time when we're retired, though many never get there... we just push those dreams aside too until we're so bitter we're mad for even being foolish enough to have dreams in the first place...

All that just to scroll through reddit or whatever and see people with life so much worse, which then makes us feel like turds for being upset that our job takes us away from our families and our homes and drives us crazy the longer we're there...

And all of that without even mentioning what it's like with overwhelming mental health issues, and/or other extenuating circumstances that make life a real shit show...
