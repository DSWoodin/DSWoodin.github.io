Hello! I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for Animation and Writing. I spend my days immersed in code, creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of technology. Whether its at my current React engineering role at Northwestern Mutual, or my personal Animation Rendering project, I spend most of my time exploring and seeing what all is out there for me to experiment on.

I'm also an Animation Enthusiast! Yes, I have a strong desire to have an outlet for my creativity through art and animation. Since switching tech stacks recently to React, I have decided to combine my Animation hobby with my React training. While during the day, I code small tasks in React, without much challenge, but at night, I dive into seeing how far I can go with React as well as my basic cat animation. I have incorporated one of my cats into my Animation Rendering project. I plan to add my other cat as soon as I have gotten more of my first cat's character developed fully. 

Dialing this back. So as a budding writer, I use this space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights. From in-depth technical guides and industry culture pieces to personal reflections, you'll find a wide range of topics here. My goal is to unravel the complexities of technology and make it accessible to everyone. I aim to provide practical tips, effective strategies, and helpful techniques for self-learning in the tech field. I believe in the power of shared experiences and plan to offer insights from my own journey. A significant part of my narrative will be dedicated to chronicling my adventures with my React project. 

Iâ€™m committed to maintaining transparency and fostering a dialogue with my readers. Feel free to leave comments or feedback on any of my projects listed. I am always open to learning new things and appreciate any constructive feedback given.

And when I'm not coding, watching/creating animations, or writing, I'm a proud Cat Mom. My cats, Butters (14) and Margie (13), keep me company and remind me to take breaks and enjoy the little things in life.

So, whether you're here for the tech insights, the animation discussions, the engaging writing, or the occasional cat story, welcome! I'm glad you're here, and I hope you find something that resonates with you.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
