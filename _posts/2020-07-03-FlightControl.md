Excited to share a project I've been working on with Almog Lev, Ofir Netzer and Sapir Deutscher.

The project features a flight control RESTful web application.

The back-end was built using C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework (with in-memory SQL DB). We created a RESTful API using WebAPI. For unit testing we used Moq.

The front-end was built using JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax and HTML. For the UI design we used bootstrap and CSS.

The web application features a flight control system that shows active flights, enables adding new flight plans and shows details about each flight. Upon clicking on a flight, its path is shown on the map.

You can check out the git repo [here](https://github.com/eyalgolan/FlightControl).
