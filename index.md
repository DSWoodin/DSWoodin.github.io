### Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin. I study the politics of business, primarily at the international level; topics of particular interest include international economic law, taxation, public-private governance, and diplomacy. Some of my work has been published in International Organization, The Review of International Organizations, Business and Politics, and AEA: Papers and Proceedings. I received a BA in Political Science from Temple University in 2017.
