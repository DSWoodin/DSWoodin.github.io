 You're in a toxic environment.  Full stop.  Your office is full of insensitive, rude, thoughtless people.

You are not imagining things.  You're not crazy.

You should know that the problem is not you; it's them.  Their attitudes.  Their lack of acceptance of others with different tastes.  Their cliqueishness and refusal to reach out to welcome a newcomer.

Sadly, the situation is not going to change.  It's a corporate culture that existed before you were there and will exist after you're gone.

I know all this because I've been in this situation before, on two occasions (minus the sexual inappropriateness--I'm a guy).

Reaching out to them will only backfire.  Inviting yourself along to lunch will only lead to awkward, icky lunches.

But here's what you can do.  What you must do, before your sense of self-worth is destroyed.  Before you begin to feel like a "thing".  Before your self image becomes twisted and you begin to struggle with depression like I did.

Find another job.  Now.  Where people are warm and open and friendly.  Or at least courteous.

I implore you to.  Don't wait until you are worn down by their crummy behavior and feel unable to move.

There are lots of other jobs out there and you deserve better.  I can tell from your post that you're a quality person that would be an asset to another company where your coworkers would appreciate, respect, and embrace you.

Get yourself into a better situation.  You'll be glad you did.  I wish someone had told me this the first time instead of me waiting around hoping things would get better!

Good luck.
