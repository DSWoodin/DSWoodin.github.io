title: Destiny 2 Season of Dawn Weapons Retrospective
subtitle: Asking and answering the important question of why the best weapons were the best
---

When it comes to answering the question of "What's the best gun in Destiny 2 for PvP?" answering that question is fairly easy. All you need to do is head over to [Destiny Tracker's Insights page](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights) and see what the most used guns are, and those are probably the best. Answering the question of *why*, however, can be somewhat difficult, as there are a multitude of ways one weapon can hold an edge over another. From varying stats, differing time-to-kill (TTK) values between sub-types, different perk pools, or, in the case of exotic weapons, special abilities, these are just a few ways some weapons can rise in use amongst so many choices.

By far one of the most used types of primary weapons, and weapons in general, are hand cannons. These guns make up over a quarter of all weapons used in the crucible, rivalling that of every other primary weapon type combined. These aptly-named slow-firing revolvers pack quite a punch, with most, if not all, being able to down an enemy guardian in a second or less. These weapons are killer in the hands of skilled players, usually knocking out an opposing guardian in three shots (or three bursts, in the case of Crimson), and are also an exceptional primary weapon choice for mid-range battles.

With the nerf to hand cannon range that came with the previous season, Season of Undying, all hand cannons, regardless of archetype, now start falling off in damage between twenty-three meters at a range stat of 0, and twenty-six meters at 100. This has resulted in a rise in popularity of lightweight hand cannons like Spare Rations, whose archetype grants them implicitly high handling, essentially changing a battle of range to a battle of speed. In this case, lightweight hand cannons (and by extension Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten) reign supreme, because not only do they have the fastest optimal time-to-kill, but their stats are higher in the catagories that matter, namely handling, aim assistance, and reload speed.
