My name is hosang Lee. I have the following qualities:

- I like hamburgers the best in the world. hey hamburgers "Break the earth!!!"
- I always take cabbages because I don't have a good stomach. Maybe it's because I spend a lot of time sitting down.

What else do you need?

### My story

Do everything you want to do.
It's not too late to regret it later.
**Let's not regret it.**
