 We have "Art After Dark" here at the art museum. It opens up on the last Friday of every month after hours. You can buy a yearlong membership to the museum & all of its events for $30. Basically you get dressed up swanky, drink a few cocktails, check out all the art galleries after closing time with other people over 21-years-old, & there's usually live music, performances, food trucks, & special exhibits.

Also, pitching a blanket on the beach or at a botanical garden & having a picnic or wine with snacks for sunset.
