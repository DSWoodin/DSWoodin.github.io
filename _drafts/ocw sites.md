This list reflects the most rigorous courses I could find

â€‹

Hillsdale College Free Online Offerings - includes the entire Hillsdale College Core Curriculum (very high quality)

MIT OCW Scholar courses - rigorous courses that reflect actual in-person MIT courses (limited offerings at the Scholar level)

Carnegie Mellon University OLI - includes many introductory courses at a quality similar to MIT OCW (information dense courses)

Saylor Academy - Offers many different complete college courses. The materials are sourced from places like MIT OCW (entirely free and they offer ACE approved college credit for most of their courses)
