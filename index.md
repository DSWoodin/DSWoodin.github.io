Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher specializing in energy systems, policy design, and techno-economic modeling.

## Research

The purpose of my work is to enable evidence-based decision making. I study sustainable energy systems, the effects of alternative policy choices, and how to design climate policy that best meets societal goals. 

My research is interdisciplinary, leveraging diverse methods matched to the problem at hand. I specialize in systems engineering and operations research approaches, and integrate tools and insights from other disciplines including economics, data science, and political science. 

My PhD work is on strategies and policies for the electrification of transport. Deep electrification is a cornerstone of effective climate change policy. I investigate electrification from a systems perspective and explore how to overcome the engineering, economic, and policy challenges in the way of integrating vehicles into the electric grid.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electrical power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([Energy System Planning group](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel/research)), an External Researcher at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](http://ceepr.mit.edu), and a certified Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com).

Previously, I was a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, where I advised public and private sector decision makers on carbon markets. 

I have testified in front of legislators on climate policy, served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing, and briefed senior staff at Fortune Global 500 companies. I advised on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System and my work was featured in policy hearings in the EU Parliament and the EU Commission, contributing to, in the words of one lawmaker: "a cool-headed debate". My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.
