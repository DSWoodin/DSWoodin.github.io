ARTankGame is an AR two player shooting game, created by Eyal Golan and Yuval Kasner.
The game sets the playfield on a surface with 2 projectile tanks and 2 playable tanks. The goal - destroy the enemy! but avoid the projectiles missles, that just don’t stop shooting at you! You can drive with 1 toggle button and fire with the other. The player that dies last – wins.
The game also contains background music and sound effects when the tanks move, shoot and explode.
There is health bar just above each tank, indicating it’s current health level.
how to play:
To start playing the game, point your camera to a plane – preferably a desk. A small white square will appear. Pressing on the square will place the playfield on the plane.
In order to move a tank, press its movement toggle in the direction you wish to move it. 
In order to shoot, press the fire toggle.
