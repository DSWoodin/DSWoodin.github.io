# MDS Capstone via Zoom: A lookback

Hello dear reader,

This blogpost aims to share some of our learnings from the MDS Capstone project. If you‚Äôre a new student or a current student reading
this after completing your block 6 coursework, congratulations! We wish you the very best in your capstone journey and hope that some
of the following tips might serve you well during your project. Put on your data science hats and read on!

## Project Management
### Have a realistic timeline, give a buffer for your intended timeline

8-weeks for capstone projects is double the time of your earlier group projects in MDS, and it may make you think you have more time.
However, more often than not, people tend to overestimate their productivity. Furthermore, from our experience, the first week for the
hackathon and the last two weeks for presentation, testing & documentation went by much quicker than we realized, hence the core time
for the project development was actually around 5 weeks.

Therefore, having a realistic timeline is key to a successful and engaging capstone experience. This involves having an honest and open
discussion on what your team can realistically accomplish in the middle 5 weeks at the very start of the project, which may result in
moderating the intended scope set by the Capstone partner. Also, don‚Äôt feel compelled to fulfill all of the partner's requirements. We
believe the Capstone partner would be more appreciative that we spend time thinking about attainable objectives, be upfront to them on
this and over-deliver, than promise the sky and under-deliver in the end. This has worked out well for us.
 
Moreover, as unexpected requirements or analyses may arise as you progress through your project development phase, our next two-cents
are that you should also consider adding a buffer to your intended timeline. For our project, we always tried to set a benchmark
timeline with a buffer based on initial estimates and continuously track our progress and adjust them along the way.


### Have an agenda and a meeting moderator for each meeting with the faculty mentor/Capstone partner

You‚Äôll be surprised at how quickly time flies in those meetings. Moreover, both your faculty mentor and Capstone partner have a full
time work schedule to keep up, so make those minutes count when you get to meet them. What our group did was to always prepare and send
out agendas to those involved before each meeting and stick to the agenda during the meeting. We also ordered the discussion points by
priority so the crucial points get to be discussed and resolved first in case we do not have time to address all items during the
meeting. In addition, our team members took turns to be the meeting moderator who was in charge of ensuring the discussion moved along
in the right direction and at the right pace. Such practices help everyone set the right frame of mind before joining the meeting, and
be on the topic during it. Productivity point: check, professionalism point: double-check! üòâ


### "If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together."

This African wisdom applies beautifully to our capstone experience. As people come from different backgrounds with various skill sets,
one‚Äôs weakness can be someone else‚Äôs strength, thus we are stronger as a unified team. For example, members with more programming
experience can guide and assist others with less experience to reduce individual struggle and increase team productivity. Similarly,
those who are familiar with project management can shed some light on best practices which the rest can learn from. Our team found
those group working sessions, even via Zoom, where we can leverage on all our members' skills, not only brought us together but also
allowed us to ‚Äúgo farther‚Äù in terms of learning during our capstone project. So do lend a hand when your teammates need help! 


## Communication

### Agree with the Capstone partner on expected products

Be clear and realistic from the beginning. It is imperative to have a project schedule which caters to the team‚Äôs capabilities and the
two month capstone timeline. Focus on the main part of your project such as the data science workflow instead of complementary
components like an overcomplicated UI. Therefore, it is very beneficial to have a well thought out project plan and clearly defined
deliverables and ensure that the Capstone partner agrees and consents to the same by the end of the first week. For projects which have
evolving goals, ensure that the team‚Äôs vision is aligned with the capstone partner‚Äôs expectations through continuous communication.

### Hold regular meetings with your faculty mentor and Capstone partner 

If feasible, it is advisable to split your 1-hour weekly meeting with your faculty mentor into two 30-minute sessions, one early and
one later in the week. Depending on everyone‚Äôs time schedules, one of these sessions can be online. Doing so is more effective towards
iterative development by receiving more frequent and timely feedback from the faculty mentor on your progress. Also, make sure you give
a weekly update to your Capstone partner in which you talk about the data science methods, incremental findings and next steps. Weekly
meetings with the Capstone partner can be a great platform for you to discuss ideas, clarify questions and seek their expert inputs.


### Ask for more data if needed 

During the EDA stage, if you observe that the data provided is unrealistic or insufficient for your model, do not hesitate to clarify
with the Capstone partner and ask for more data if needed. Though it is harder to gather more data during later stages of the project,
make sure to continue to evaluate your data needs during model development. Having sufficient and appropriate data is crucial for
obtaining robust results.
