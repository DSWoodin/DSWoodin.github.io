policing the tactics of revolutionary groups without handling the grievances against the status quo that they have

the actual problems are just ignored

be compassionate to people and ruthless to systems - Michael brooks

1 - villains shown in this way to vilify real world leftist talking points
populist
anticapitalist 
2 - tactics - poverty is stigmatised but social systems do not support this. moralising. 
we always want to keep the status quo.
