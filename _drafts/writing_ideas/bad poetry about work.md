my job is my choker
shopping is in my veins

second to second, whatever
 I do my master deigns

my chains coolly embrace me
unconscious, I burn

I never really feel lonely
can you label a feeling unlearned?

what was life like before
untethered from the spider silk

in days of yore
before we were just cattle to milk

will I ever know
or will I keep running/hoarding till I go?
