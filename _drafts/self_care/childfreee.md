 This is a huge reason why I 99.9999999999999% don’t want kids, to be honest. I don’t want some guy pressuring me into it, with promises that it would be a 50/50 split of responsibilities, but when it comes down to it, the woman nearly always does more... even when the guy was more excited about kids than the woman was! And when they both work full time! How is that fair?
