Privilege is magnified when you are fighting for a top spot in an ultra competitive field. The majority of men do not exist in these ultra competitive fields and only see minor gains from their privilege. So when a feminist yells about how privileged men are we reflexively want to disagree with them because it does not align with our personal experiences.

I think both parties could do better in this situation. Some men use this lack of nuance to downplay the influence privilege has on society and completely shut out feminist talking points. While some feminists are heavy handed with their phrasing and shut out men from sharing their experiences.
