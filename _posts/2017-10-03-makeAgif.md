In creating *'how to'* posts I've found that there are plenty of times where a screen capture would save me *loads* of time rather than typing out step by step instructions. While static screen grabs are often used, there are moments where a video recording of my screen would be much more helpful. Unfortunately the Markdown syntax used within these Github-hosted pages doesn't allow for the import of certain file types; namely video-style formats of any kind. Bummer.  

Fortunately there is a workaround - you can import .gif files and treat them just like static images as far as the Markdown syntax is concerned. My workflow for generating through publishing .gif files in a Markdown style format is as follows.  

## Step 1 - Make your movie
I have a Mac, which has Quicktime, which is just about all I ever need to do basic screen capture work. See [this tutorial](http://etc.usf.edu/techease/4all/getting-started/creating-screen-recordings-with-quicktime-player/) for one example (there are many) using such an approach. Ultimately you need to generate a .mov file to carry on to **Step 2** next.  

## Step 2 - Install software to convert .mov file to .gif
Thanks to Alex D for this *suuuper* easy to use piece of software: [screengif](https://github.com/dergachev/screengif) Install instructions are provided on the default README.md page, but note you're going to have to also install a few dependencies. In case that's unfamiliar I'll walk you through it a few ways starting from the ground up.  

> To the impatient - see his page directly for a Docker-based implementation if you know what you're doing...  

- Do you have a package manager installed? I used Conda. If yes, proceed.  
  - No? [start here](https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/), though I'd argue you're best of using either [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) like I do or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  

- Do you have Ruby installed? If yes, proceed.
  - No? Okay, assuming you're doing it either the Conda or Brew way:
  ```
  ## Conda
  conda install -c bioconda ruby

  ## Brew
  brew install ruby
  ```

If you're set up with Homebrew, install of the program and all other dependencies is a breeze:
```
brew install ffmpeg 
brew cask install x-quartz #dependency for gifsicle, only required for mountain-lion and above
open /usr/local/Cellar/x-quartz/2.7.4/XQuartz.pkg # runs the XQuartz installer
brew install gifsicle
```

However if you're like me using Conda, you have to work a little harder.  

First, confirm you have XQuartz installed: 
```
ls /opt/X11
```
See anything listed? If yes, proceed.
- If no, [install from here](https://www.xquartz.org/) . 

Next, install a few other dependencies:
```
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
conda install -c kalefranz imagemagick
conda install -c anaconda pkgconfig
```

## Step 3 - run the software

## Step 4 - insert a .gif file with Markdown syntax
