My name is Zachary Luck, currently, I'm a Lambda school student studying data science.

I've been into computers and numbers as far back as I can remember, some of my favorite games, like PAYDAY 2, Path of Exile, and Destiny 2 involve a hefty amount of number-crunching and theorycrafting in order to make the most optimal builds, something I always enjoy doing.

This website will eventually host a portfolio of various projects I've created, but for right now it'll be kinda barren.
