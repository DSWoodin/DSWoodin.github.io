 I haven't seen too many people put together an actual plan but here is how I did it for 4 years and across two different countries (decided to move country in this time period)

1. Meal prep - 4 hours on a Sunday saves you  a bunch of time in the week.
2. Sprint planning - I'm an inconsistent person and need a break from things. I tested how long I could keep on the same task/project without getting bored found it to be about 3 weeks. I would do a 3 week on 1 week off kind of cycle. For 3 weeks I would drown myself in everything about my courses, 1 week I would totally disregard them. Did sprint planning and sprint review sessions with myself too.
3. Real application - I would volunteer for projects at work where I could apply what I'm learning, if none existed I would try to propose one.
4. Take application driven courses - they are better suited to learning and you don't have a study time sink
