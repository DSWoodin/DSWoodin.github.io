title: Processing Reddit Data to Tackle Police Brutality

## Background

This project was made in conjunction with Human Rights First, an independant advocacy and action organization. The work they do is centered around getting America to stand up to its ideals, and in doing so, they sought the help of Lambda School for their project. Their challenge to my group and I, as well as two other groups of students here at Lambda, was to see if we could make a map of continental America that showed events of police brutality, using data aggregated from Reddit and Twitter.

While most of the issues pertaining to the website and getting that to work fell to the Web Development team, the issue of sourcing and cleaning data fell to myself and my team member, Chris. The requirements of the project meant that we would be creating a FastAPI web app deployed via ElasticBeanstalk to Amazon Web Services (AWS), something that neither of us had done before, but other than that, our options for going about sourcing the data and cleaning it were entirely open to us.

### Initial Worries

At first, both Chris and I worried about using FastAPI and AWS; we'd never worked with either framework, so we worried that we'd have to spend a fair amount of time learning how it works and getting it set up. On further inspection, we realised that FastAPI beared a striking resemblance to Flask, another kind of web-app framework, but came with a built-in user interface that allowed us to test the functions of our app. As for the Amazon Web Services, we haven't gotten that far, but we expect to have an app built later this week.

## API Roadmap Breakdown

At the start of working on the project, we broke down what we thought we'd need to make in order to get our app running. This included things like finding a source of data, cleaning it, getting the app up and running, and outputting the cleaned data through an endpoint in the app. There were also times during working on the project where there was some confusion with how the data would flow from the API to the backend, and at one point, Chris and I had set up a database to hold data because there was some miscommunication as to who would be sanitizing the data for duplicates.
