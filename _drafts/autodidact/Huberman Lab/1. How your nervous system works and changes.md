Nervous system = brain, spinal cord, connections between body and both
nervous system tells your spleen to deploy immune cells
pain -> nerves

governs all other biological systems and is influenced by others
cajal and golgi learned how to stain cells and figured out that neurons exist and are separated by space - synapse

you are a flow of electricity 

memories are stored as patterns of electricity and neurons that when repeated you feel you are experiencing the thing again

deja vu = reactivation of the neurons

electrical activity dictates our experience

warfare
- bullets caused specific lesions in nervous system -> collection of patients with different conditions -> figured out which parts of the brain were for what

speech and lang are controlled by different sections of the brain

brain is a map of experience
## features of the nervous sytems
### sensation -> perceive light, movement, touch, sounds, etc
life is filtered by the sensory perception
snakes can sense heat emissons but we can't
turtles and birds can detect magnetic fields
### perception
whichever sensations we are paying attention to.
covert attention, overt
bottom up processing - reflexive
top down processing - deliberate
### feelings/emotions
product of nervous system, neurons also release chemicals
neuromodulators - dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine
bias the active and inactive neurons
neuromodulators - playlist for neurons
serotonin - when released make us feel good with what we have
dopamine - pursue outside good things

antidepressants and antipsychotics
receptors for neuromodulators cause the effects that they make
certain circuits tend to be active when sad / focused / motivated

many of these are reflexive
### thoughts
can be reflexive or deliberate, past and planning
### actions
fossil record of us is through action
sherrington movement is the final common pathway. nobel prize

central pattern generators - groups of neurons that generate that movement
deliberate movement - engage brain for top down processing 

ability to change your nervous system by doing deliberate things. analysis of three things (DPO)
- duration
- path - what are you doing
- outcome

engaging these brain circuits using top down processing

impulsitivty is a lack of top down control
adrenaline makes you feel agitated, especially when you supress a circuit

limbic system -> primitive responses of the brain

agitation and strain is the entrypoint to neuroplasticity

neuroplasticity
- neurons can change their connections and the way they work.
i.e deliberate to reflexive
adaptive plasticity

adult what to do when you want to change
- whic part of my nervous sytem am i trying to change?
- how to go about that? -> governed by how awake or how sleepy we are

brain can change itself

young brains very plastic older brains still plastic but not as much

plasticity in adults is gated by neuromodulators

when something bad happens
- epinephrine - creating alertness (some in brain stem), acetylcholine (forebrain)-> highlights the specific neurons
when we want this to happen
- alertness to get focus and focus to highlight the pathways

no plasticitly happens during the events, all of it happens when we are in sleep / non sleep deep rest

20mins of deep rest, after hard work accelerated neuroplasticity
a tone is played during learning, if it is played during sleep then learning rates increased -> cue to nervous system to remember

emotional load of memories can be reduced

two phase process
- autonomic nervous system 

alertness (sympathetic) and calmness system
morning -> night

sleep is critical to health
you are paralysed during sleep 

sleep quality, when to time sleep ? 

rhythms of waking states - when brain is optimised for focus ? reflexive behaviours?

circadian -> day
ultradian -> throughout the day -> 90 min phases (1-4) for focus and attention.
seesaw of alertness to calmness that helps you learn 

when is brain most anxious, most motivated/least motivated
