Cannot open the Outlook window."</h5><br/><b>Cause and FIX</b><br/>This problem can occur when file that maintains the Navigation Pane settings becomes corrupted. This file is called profilename.xml, where profilename is the name of your Outlook profile. This file is stored in the following folder:<br/><br/>•Windows XP<br/><br/>C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook<br/><br/>•Windows Vista, Windows 7<br/><br/>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook<br/>A good indication this file is corrupted is when the file size is 0 KB.<br/><br/><b>To resolve this problem</b>, use the following steps.<br/><br/>1.On the Start menu click Run.<br/>2.In the Run dialog box, type the following command:<br/><br/>Outlook.exe /resetnavpane<br/><br/>Note: There is a space between "Outlook.exe" and "/resetnavpane"<br/><br/>3.Click OK<br/><h5>Issue: Exchange 2003 SP2 and Outlook 2007, mapped mailbox indicates the inbox has one or more unread messages.  However, they are not being displayed in the reading pane.</h5><br/>Connecting directly to the mailbox via wmail reveals the unread messages as well many more read emails that were not present in the mapped mailbox.<br/><br/><b>Cause and FIX</b><br/><br/>1 You are able to see all emails when connecting to the mailbox directly (i.e via wmail) but not as a mapped mailbox. The reason is the emails are being sent with a special properties set. The 'sensitivity' setting is defined as 'Private' which mean only the intended recipient user can see the email not users sharing the mailbox.<br/><h5>Issue: Outlook starts with the error message "There is no email program associated to perform the requested action"</h5><br/><b>Cause and FIX</b><br/>After clicking on the OK button Outlook appears to respond correctly. Does not relate to missing Plugins or other messages, only when you start Outlook the first time.  Looking at Default file extensions in Windows 7 was not revealing as the current settings mimic another working computer.<br/><br/>After investigation the FIX involved copying [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\Microsoft Outlook] registry from another working computer.  The computer with the error message was missing all of the keys even after re-installing the software.<br/><br/><strong>Issue: If a user has an issue where PowerPoint changes the hyperlink the user inputs from (e.g.) M:\Eng\pdfexample.pdf to ../../root/eng/pdfexample.pdf then please follow the below instructions to fix:</strong><br/><br/>Following stops PowerPoint messing with links on save.<br/><br/>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; General -&gt; Web Options -&gt; Files -&gt; Update links on save.<br/>Needs to be unchecked.
