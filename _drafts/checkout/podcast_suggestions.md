# podcast suggestions

 SGU is by far my favorite. I started listening to it while doing my weekly cleaning routine on Saturdays. Now I’m at a point where I look forward to cleaning because that’s when I get to listen to the SGU. 

I also recommend Clear and Vivid with Alan Alda which is all about communication and it’s  so conversational that even the adds are in the form of a conversation with his producer(?). Plus, Alan Alda is awesome and he has some pretty cool guests on as well. 

Stephen Fry’s Great Leap Years is another one OP could listen to. It’s a narrative, instead of a conversation, but I can’t think of anyone more articulate than Stephen Fry.
