On March 14, 2023 I found myself giving my first public conference talk ever. At my first-ever Python conference! This post is to mark the event and to reflect on how quickly things fell into place.

## Seamless experience

After hearing about [Reshma Saujani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAibQQBTiAn2pwkbuO-2jMyWyMMBr30PqM)'s 'brave girls' mindset twice in one day the week before, I began to wonder if it was a sign that I needed to act on. Twice is enough to catch someone's attention, isn't it? At the start of the [#PWC2023](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=pwc2023&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7041593706444939264), I received another hint. During the opening remarks, [Calvin Hendryx-Parker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA6RfEBXH_gmmVFFE95S9wfMhaZHJws2oI) invited attendees to sign up for Lightning Talks - 5-minute talks aimed at inspiring thoughts and igniting future collaborations.

It wasn't until the first end-of-day social that I mustered the courage to sign up: after hearing from several first-time speakers who had either just delivered their talk, or were scheduled to deliver one, or were shortly after, I couldn't resist and blurted out, "I want to give it a shot too!" Little did I know that I would be scheduled to speak in just 18 hours.

## Behind the scences

In the morning, I managed to put together several slides to create a storyline, but I had no time for editing or practice[! practice! practice!]. And there I was, delivering my first talk on the struggles of the chemical industry to monitor precise carbon footprint of their products. It wasn't a perfect talk (of course, I did fix the slides afterwards ðŸ˜…), but it turned out to be a perfect fit with [Hillary Lovric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAWs6l0BycAqreW8ZA5fU0fNnD-JzhjsMUM) 's talk on the value of individual contribution into augmenting the existing corporate data and, thus, closing the gaps to enable accurate tracking of the emissions and [Alex Smolyak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAO-9mUBWLHvKkIQPw2psSh_k_fI1rOxPds)'s phenomenal deep dive into wastewater intelligence.

I am immensely grateful to [Calvin Hendryx-Parker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA6RfEBXH_gmmVFFE95S9wfMhaZHJws2oI), [Darcy Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADTff8BCK7UDKKvOYDK6k2KRbixfPpyLSE), [Laura Stephens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAGJdwABlZup6ZolmXh02z-T8JzlqjJree4), [Chris May](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAtj0EBa4iX7CT8V13tKUc_wSOZ6L5t3hI), [James Spadafora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAVjehgBXfpyx32NpIULxKSRGF5VvvvRH9k), [Mario Munoz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAU78sEBQANIeKIGKmXc--m31TVE5V6grjI) for the inspiration and support! ðŸ™Œ
