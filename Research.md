<div>[3] <a href="assets/TJ_BAP_final.pdf">Who's Afraid of Sunlight? Explaining Opposition to Transparency in Economic Development</a> (with Nathan M. Jensen)<br>
  <em><strong>Business and Politics</em></strong>, 2021, 23(4): 471-494.<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Firms and governments often negotiate economic development deals, such as tax abatements, with limited
transparency, using exceptions to public records laws or other strategies for nondisclosure. In this article
we explore the motivations of firms for keeping economic development deals out of the public eye. We
explore legal challenges to public records requests for deal-specific, company-specific participation in a
state economic development incentive program. By examining applications for participation in a major
state economic program, the Texas Enterprise Fund, we find that a company is more likely to challenge a
formal public records request if it has renegotiated the terms of the award to reduce its job-creation obligations. We interpret this as companies challenging transparency when they have avoided being penalized for
noncompliance by engaging in nonpublic renegotiations. These results provide evidence regarding those conditions that prompt firms to challenge transparency and illustrate some of the limitations of safeguards such
as clawbacks (or incentive-recapture provisions) when such reforms aren’t coupled with robust transparency
mechanisms. We speculate that the main motivation for these challenges is to limit scrutiny of these deals
that could lead to backlashes against future economic development agreements.

[2] [Public-Private Initiatives and Corporate Responses to Stakeholder Complaints](assets/Thrall_IO_2021_final.pdf)<br>
**_International Organization_**, 2021, 75(3): 803-836.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

Multinational firms operate in multiple national jurisdictions, making them
difficult for any one government to regulate. For this reason the firms themselves are often
in charge of their own regulation, increasingly in conjunction with international organizations by way of public-private governance initiatives. Prior research has claimed that such
initiatives are too weak to meaningfully change firms’ behavior. Can public-private governance initiatives help firms self-regulate, even if they lack strong monitoring or enforcement mechanisms? I take two steps toward answering this question. First, I introduce a
new measure of firms’ performance on ESG (environmental, social, and governance)
issues: the extent to which the firms issue public responses to claims of misconduct
from civil society actors. Second, I argue that public-private governance initiatives
allow firms to benefit from the legitimacy of their public partners, lowering the reputational cost of transparent response. Employing novel data on firm responses to human
rights allegations from the Business and Human Rights Resource Center, I find that membership in the largest and most prominent initiative, the United Nations Global Compact,
significantly increases firms’ propensity to respond transparently to stakeholder allegations. These results suggest a limited but important role for public-private initiatives in
global governance.

Historically, international investment law has centered on protecting foreign
investors from direct expropriation, but much of modern law includes legal
standards that allow investors to win compensation for other kinds of
investor-state disputes. A prominent criticism among scholars and policy
advocates is that modern legal protections allow investors to pursue increasing
numbers of frivolous, low-merit cases. We contend that this claim overlooks
the impact of judicial economy and changing legal standards: since foreign
investors only need to prove a main legal violation to secure compensation,
arbitrators can and do rule only on those standards that are most easily
proven, in particular, contemporary legal protections. As a result, measures
based on legal claims and rulings cannot provide definitive evidence of merit,
and fears about trends in frivolous litigation under international investment
law may be overstated.

How does capital mobility impact the relationship between plutocrats and the state?
We argue that the interaction of offshore finance and international law changes the
strategy and sites of political contestation. By routing their investments through off-
shore shell companies, plutocrats can become de jure foreign investors in their home
markets. We argue that plutocrats prefer routing their wealth through jurisdictions
that have an investment treaty with their home state; these treaties allow plutocrats
to file binding investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) against their own governments.
We test the theory using incorporation-level data from the Panama Papers and data
on the beneficial ownership of entities involved in ISDS. We find that extraterritorial
arbitrations make up 8% of ISDS cases but account for 41% of the total damages
claimed. The paper contributes to debates on the effects of globalization on political
development and the emerging research agenda on the IPE of Oligarchy.

[Spillover Effects in International Law: Evidence from Tax Planning](assets/taxplanning_postJMP.pdf) <br>
**David A. Lake Award** for best paper presented at IPES 2020. Under Review.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Multinational firms frequently engage in indirect investment, holding ownership of
their foreign assets through shell companies incorporated in third states. This allows
them to arbitrage other states' international agreements; increasingly, firms engage in
a practice I call proxy arbitration, using their shell companies to file investor-state disputes against their host states using other states' bilateral investment treaties. I argue
that proxy arbitration—which dramatically increases the scope of the international
  investment regime—is actually a <em>spillover effect</em> of corporate tax avoidance. Firms
establish indirect ownership structures in order to access the bilateral tax treaty network, which lowers the tax rate charged on cross-border capital transfers. However, tax
and investment treaty networks overlap extensively; investors who sought tax treaty
coverage often gain investment treaty coverage as a side benefit, enabling them to file
proxy arbitration in the event of a dispute. Using novel, fine-grained data on the
ownership structures of multinational firms—including those that filed investor-state
disputes and those that did not—I find evidence in support of the spillover effects theory. The results suggest that understanding the true political and economic impacts
of global governance institutions requires attention to how firms strategically change
their legal forms to access or avoid them, as well as how corporate arbitrage in one
regime spills over into others.

[Treaty Diplomacy and the Global Firm](assets/treaty_regimes_IPES.pdf)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
 Over the course of the 20th century, states have developed large networks of bilateral or small-group economic treaties in several issue areas. These treaties, which are
important tools of foreign economic policy, redistribute the gains and losses of globalization. Why do states sign treaties with some partners and not others? Motivated
by the observation that the same pairs of states tend to sign multiple treaties within a
short time period, I develop a theory of treaty regime coevolution that centers corporate
demand for treaties. Firms expand into new foreign markets in search of profit, paying
fixed costs to do so. However, once the initial cost is paid, these firms become the
primary beneficiaries of any future treaty between home and host states. Incumbent
firms therefore have incentive to lobby home state legislators and diplomats in favor of
signing treaties with their host states, across several issue areas. Strong private sector
demand can lead to the formation of multiple types of treaties between pairs of states,
  creating <em>firm-driven interdependence</em> across treaty networks. Using quantitative and
qualitative data—including novel data from the USSR, declassified diplomatic cables,
and elite interviews—I find support for my theory. The results have implications for
the decline of multilateralism in foreign policy, and suggest new avenues for studying
the effects of treaties.

[The Promise of Economic Integration: Evidence from the First Bank in an American Indian Nation](assets/WFT_Nov2021_final_identified.pdf) (with Donna Feir and Rachel L. Wellhausen)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
American Indian Nation “A” exercised its sovereignty in negotiating the entry of the first
bank to its underserved reservation. The bank, Nation A’s only modern foreign investment,
is owned by American Indian Nation “B.” We conduct a first-of-its-kind survey of Nation A’s
tribal members in the months before the bank’s groundbreaking. This unique opportunity
allows us to investigate drivers of individuals’ support for and, crucially, willingness to become
customers of the bank. Without deception, we explore effects of the bank’s ownership, as well as
randomized interventions cueing Nation A’s endorsement and general support from the Federal
Reserve. We find high baseline buy-in, especially given the bank’s nationality, but weak and even
counterproductive treatment effects. Exploratory analyses suggest backfire among low-income
respondents. This troubling result reinforces the relevance of non-Westphalian sovereigns to
building theory around the consequential choices that they too make over economic integration.

[Global Value Chains as a Constraint on Sovereignty: Evidence from Investor-State Dispute Settlement](assets/mtw_sep_2021.pdf) (with Carolina Moehlecke and Rachel L. Wellhausen)<br>
Under Review.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
That economic integration constrains state sovereignty has been a longstanding concern and
the subject of much study. We assess the validity of this concern in the context of two very
particular components of contemporary economic globalization: development-enhancing global
value chain (GVC) integration and Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). We argue that
multinational corporations (MNCs) with the potential to disrupt GVC integration are more
likely to see host state regulations changed in their favor. Contemporary ISDS arbitration, in
which MNCs sue host states over alleged violations of investment treaties, make this process
visible. Using the non-parametric difference-in-differences estimator by Imai, Kim and Wang
(2020), we connect ISDS filings to substantial decreases in GVC trade. We bring that finding
to our novel dataset, in which we document that host states have abandoned 24% of regulations
disputed in ISDS (1987-2017). Our argument and evidence suggest that, in combination, GVC
integration and ISDS can grow an MNC’s power to such an extent that the host state quite
literally abandons a regulation that the MNC disputes.
