:cherry_blossom:No “nothing matters, so why try?”

:cherry_blossom:No justifying the negative thoughts.

:cherry_blossom:No “but I’m not pretty so I can’t wear that”

:cherry_blossom:No “I don’t deserve good things”

:cherry_blossom:No “I need to punish myself”

:cherry_blossom:No “self love doesn’t make sense”

Self love starts when you stop arguing against it. When you actively start to cut out the toxic habits and self talk. When you actually start to forgive yourself and be understanding. When you understand progress over perfection.

I’ve argued with myself because “self love doesn’t make sense”. And I couldn’t stop feeling guilty about what people in real life thought of me. Or even just the fact that I’m so far behind them. So I didn’t feel like I deserved to not feel guilty or love myself. I thought that self care was “fake” and that i needed the negative thoughts to be more productive.

But just hating on yourself isn’t productive and it just makes you feel like shit. So why does it make sense to just hate yourself all day?

I don’t want to feel like this anymore. So I decided to actually commit to getting rid of the negative thoughts in my head. 

I’m not there yet, but I’m working on it. And it feels a lot better than just constantly beating myself up. 

Self love doesn’t mean shit unless you actually commit to it. Peace out :v:.
