# THANK YOU!
Thank you to every attendee, volunteer, panel host, and Fur Squared staffer for making this event happen!  With $11,770 already donated to HAWS, and more to be calculated from the con store (WHICH IS STILL OPEN BY THE WAY), we hope to have a final charity total revealed next week.

# Fur Squared 2022
Announcenets for next year's event will happen as we know them.  We hope to have more details in the next month, but the pandemic and vaccine distribution is going to be the biggest conditional for what we can commit to.  Follow us on twitter or check us out here to get the most up to date information.
