**Discover Your Path to Wellness with Ayurveda**
Welcome to Raki Yoga, where ancient wisdom meets modern health needs. Our seasoned Ayurvedic practitioners are here to guide you towards balance and vitality, using time-honored techniques tailored to your unique constitution.

**Personalized Care for Your Dosha**
Every individual is a unique blend of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. At Roots & Rhythms, we don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. Our consultations are carefully crafted to address your specific dosha dominance:

Vata-Focused Sessions: If you're battling restlessness, irregular sleep, or digestive ups and downs, this is for you.

Pitta-Balancing Consultations: Designed for those grappling with inflammation, skin flare-ups, or feeling constantly on edge.

Kapha-Harmonizing Appointments: Perfect if you're looking to boost metabolism, shake off lethargy, or improve respiratory health.

**Our Consultation Process**
During your visit, we'll dive deep into understanding your prakriti (innate nature) and current state of health. This involves:
A thorough chat about your health history and concerns
Tongue analysis
A look at your overall appearance and energy
Based on these insights, we'll craft a wellness plan that fits seamlessly into your life, including dietary tweaks, lifestyle adjustments, and herbal support.

**When to Visit Us**
We know life can be hectic, so we've set up our schedule to be as accommodating as possible:
Weekdays: Pop in anytime between 9 AM and 7 PM
Saturdays & Sunday : We offer virtual consultations by appointment
