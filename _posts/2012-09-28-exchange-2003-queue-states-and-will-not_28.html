My issue in particular related to the decommissioning of a Exchange 2003 server.  This server was turned off; then another Exchange server stopped sending/ receiving emails.  However, all other Exchange instances were working correctly.<br/><br/>Cause was tracked down to the "Smart host" settings entry referring to the decommissioned server.<br/><br/>Exchange server&gt; Protocols&gt; SMTP&gt; Default SMTP Virtual Server &gt; Right click Properties<br/><br/>Delivery Tab &gt; Advanced &gt; "Smart Host" entry<br/><br/>In my case i could simply remove the entry as it was not required.
