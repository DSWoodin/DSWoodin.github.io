When I was younger, an older, former military doc taught me a great lesson:

"I'm not in the convincing business"

Peace reigned in my practice. No longer did I try to "talk" diabetics into eating appropriately. Inform, give choices, tell consequences, then treat the fallout of their choices. Can only succeed when a patient is at a teachable moment.
