## Data Chapter 1

### NZ beech forests

*Merky forests. What can we expect from stoat control in NZ forests? - Food vs. Predation.*

**Abstract:** This publication clarifies the discrepancy between; two modelling papers that suggest mesopredator release of rodents is possible in New Zealand forest systems and; several field studies that have presented limited but conflicting support for increases in mouse abundance following predator control. We used an experimental design to test the differences between the two "frames of though" and found that there is no evidence to suggest mice will become more abundant after predator removal ([*additional resources can be found here*](https://davan690.github.io/)).

## Data Chapter 2

*A more complex set of interreacting invasive species.*

**Status:** [Analysis underway](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fm57ns1jndmkmq1/Davidson_2019_mpd_manuscript.docx?dl=0)

### NZ mixed forests

**Background:** This chapter will extend on the modelling explored for the beech forest system (Chapter Two). Previous research has shown that complex interactions between native and exotic species exist in NZ mixed forest systems (Ruscoe et al. 2011; Ruscoe et al. 2012). This chapter parametrises a model to account for these different interactions in an extension of the beech forest model in the previous chapter to account for different food resources and other invasive species dynamics.

**Objectives:** This chapter has the overall objective to model additional interactions and species in a New Zealand forest system. Beech forests have a limited number of species producing food for invasive mammals. When the ecosystem has more resources with different availability to the mesopredators the system is expected to have different outcomes (Choquenot & Ruscoe 2000). For example, mice populations are thought to persist in podocarp/hardwood forests at higher densities than adjoining beech forest (Choquenot & Ruscoe 2000).

To meet the objective for this chapter, the model will extend on the proposed forest model in the previous chapter to account for different food resources and other invasive species dynamics. The multi-species dataset (MPD) will allow for the modelling of native bird species and investigate more complex interactions in a different forest type.

AIMS:

1. Estimate observation models for rodents, possums, seed production and invertebrates.

2. Link these using a process model of links between species. In this process we will test multiple possible processes driving these dynamics including predator and competition release between native and invasive species.

3. Simulation studies will investigate possible errors associated with different data collection methods.

Research on the same dataset has investigated differences in the abundance indices for invasive species (Ruscoe et al. 2011). The response of invertebrates to different invasive species control was also investigated (Ruscoe et al. 2012). I will extend on these analyses to build an overall model incorporating the additional invasive species  My GIT account is a work in  [progress](https://github.com/davan690/).
