 It's a control thing.   Boss knows exactly where to find you for 8-9 hours a day if youre assigned to a cube.

If youre home...well god forbid, you may do laundry! Or..or...take a walk for a break? And then what am I supposed to do! I can't see you!  Shit, you may actually be happy and more productive because your coworkers are your dogs and you dont have people bothering you taking up your time with insane meetings.

No no, I'd much prefer you pollute the environment and waste 30-60 minutes on average a day commuting, getting less sleep, wearing clothes you dont want to wear, sitting in on meetings that take an hour which could easily be summed up via a 2 line email, and making you be around people you could care less for than your actual family.
