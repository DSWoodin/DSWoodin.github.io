We've put together a list of team tips to complement our [top 10 tips](../competition-tips). 
If you'd like to share your own, please let us know

## 1) Team competitions are all about solving math problems.
It might sound obvious, but it’s true. As a result, our [top 10 article](../competition-tips) applies just as much here.
Be familiar with those tips as they can earn you some real points in team tests as well.

## 2) Teams should practice regularly throughout the season.
A good practice is 90-120 minutes and covers all round types for the events they’ll be competing in. Don’t forget about 
individual rounds that are included as part of the team component, such as mental math. The best way to prepare for a 
competition is to use past exams from that competition, which are usually available on their web site.

We've put together a [sample team practice plan](../team-practice) that can help you get started.

## 3) Use an answer grid to coordinate work on group tests.
Group tests are tests where all team members work together on the same set of questions. The goal is to distribute work 
among the team in order to efficiently generate the highest number of correct answers. As members complete a question, they 
write their answer in the proper row/column for that question. If the first two answers for a given question agree, then that 
problem should be considered solved and nobody should work on it further.

## 4) Identify a team captain.
After a few practices, the abilities of your team members will start to come into focus. It will be helpful to identify a team 
captain, who should be one of the stronger team members who can be relied on to execute the team strategy. They will be responsible 
for coordination during the competition, such as organizing the answer grid, breaking ties among teammates, and submitting college 
bowl rebound answers.

## 5) Have a group test strategy.
An efficient strategy for approaching group tests can optimize your team's strengths and maximize your results.
One recommended group strategy is to have your two strongest members start from the last (hardest) question or group and work 
backward (10-1). The two other members start from the front and work forward (1-10). Alternatively, team members can pick and choose 
the questions they work on, although it’s very important to avoid investing too many people or too much time on the same question 
while others have not been attempted.
