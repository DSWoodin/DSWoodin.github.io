## Programming Submissions

Calling all and gearhead gadgeteers, whizzbang wizards, electric entertainers, and ingenious inventors of incredible items - we are now accepting programming submissions for Fur Squared 2024! With a new hotel comes more space, and as always we need *your* help to fill it!

If you have an event you'd like to host at F2 - a meetup, a discussion, a demonstration of your latest technology of the future - you can apply at <https://forms.gle/XGkGNkE8wwovJTSG7> until November 30th.

Never hosted an event before? Got a wacky idea but aren't sure if it'll take off? Don't be shy - we love innovation, and you'll not find a more welcoming audience! We're happy to work with you to flesh out an idea, and offer advice for running your panel.

## DJ Submissions

Calling all gadgeteers! Our DJ submissions are officially open! Think you’ve got a track the world isn’t ready for? What better time to shine than now?

Submissions will close on 12/10! More info below!

*Our DJ selection is done by a blind selection to minimize potential bias. Submissions are anonymized, then submitted to our 3 person DJ selection team for ranking and final selection.*
