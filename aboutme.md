### my history  

- Like most Canadians, I grew up loving hockey  
- Hockey allowed me to study at a tremendous college (go [Ephs!](https://www.williams.edu/))  
- That was where I met my amazing wife (fate?... [she](http://collegehockeystats.net/0506/teamstats/wilw) and [I](http://collegehockeystats.net/0506/teamstats/wilm) both wore number 10... note her PIM > my PIM)  
- After graduating from college we started our careers teaching in a few boarding schools. Dr. Burch and [her program](http://www.berkshireschool.org/academics/signature-programs/) at Berkshire School remains a huge inspiration in how I envision integrating real science with science education  
- I wanted to know more about science so I signed up for a Ph.D program, starting with Vaughn Cooper's [lab](http://micropopbio.org/), and am currently completing my dissertation research in Jeff Foster's [lab](http://fozlab.weebly.com/)  
- I'm interested in science and education; one tool integrating those themes is this website sharing what I've discovered, so here we are.  

I'm a fourth year Ph.D candidate interested in science and education. My work in Dr. Foster's focuses on bat ecology and evolution. I'm interested in identifying a genetic basis for resistance to White-nose syndrome, a disease caused by a fungal pathogen that has killed millions of bats throughout North America over the last decade.  

In addition, I am broadly interested in how scientists learn, work, and collaborate. I hope that my musings within these pages provide some insight into the challenges of scientists becoming better teachers, and teachers doing better science.
