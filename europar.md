Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have the potential to revolutionize the development of scientific high-performance software by providing scientists with abstractions that are tailored for their specific problem. By encoding rich domain knowledge by the programmer, the compilation tool-chain is then able to make effective choices around parallelism. Furthermore, if designed correctly, then the programmer is able to express their workload in an architecture-independent fashion, thus making portability across architectures possible, with the compilation tool-chain doing much of the heavy lifting.

This is especially important in HPC as even effectively exploiting today's supercomputers is fraught will difficulty and in the domain of the few experts. As we move towards exascale, with increasingly complex heterogeneous systems, the ability to fully exploit these machines will be beyond even the most experienced guru. Put simply, the languages and technologies that are currently ubiquitous in HPC (C, Fortran, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) are too low level for end-user programming and the abstraction level needs to be raised. 

The term "language" in DSLs can be a bit of a misnomer, as the name of the game here is raising the abstraction level, and consequently technologies such as abstractions embedded inside existing languages, frameworks and libraries are also highly topical. Many believe that DSLs have the potential to get us closer to achieving the three Pâ€™s; productivity, performance, and performance portability. Whilst historically this objective has been often seen as somewhat of a chimera, there is wide acceptance in the HPC community that we need to solve the programming challenges associated with future exascale machines. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that the benefits that DSLs can deliver are paramount and could be critical in unlocking the full potential of future supercomputers.

## Call for papers

There are numerous hurdles that must be overcome if DSLs are to be widely accepted, and this workshop aims to explore these different facets and enable a conversation between different parts of the community to help promote DSL adoption. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Compiler technologies supporting DSL development
- Appropriate DSL technologies and techniques for targeting HPC and parallelism
- Novel domain specific abstractions
- Success stories in porting codes to use a DSL
- Mixing DSLs with other technologies
- Consolidation of underlying DSL software stacks
- Programming heterogeneous architectures using DSLs
- Frameworks and libraries for raising the abstraction level
- Best practice for developing DSLs
- Programmer productivity studies  

### Submission instructions
We invite you to submit research papers detailing original work. All submissions must be in PDF format and follow the [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Papers should not exceed 12 pages (including references) and can be submitted via the Euro-Par 2022 workshops Easychair [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=europar2022) (ensure you select the correct track to submit to which is _EuroPar Workshop on Domain Specific Languages for High Performance Computing 2022_).

All submitted research papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be included in the workshop post-proceedings published by Springer. Please note that for a paper to be published it must be between 10 and 12 pages long.
