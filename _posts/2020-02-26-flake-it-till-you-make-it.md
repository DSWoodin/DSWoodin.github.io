# Experimental Research Chapter 5

advantages | disadvantages
-----------|--------------
can infer cause and effect| can you generalize?
have control |

## Independant variable (I.V)
- The var that the experimenter manipulates
- the situation that the experimeneter is creating to see if it affect behaviour
## Dependant Variable (D.V)
- the behaviour that moeasure to see if the I.V has an effect
## Extranenous Variable
- var that are of no interest to the experimenter, but could affect behaviour if not controlled properly. As long as they are controlled/held constant(all groups have same exposure to var).
## Confounding Variable
- is extraneuous variable that is not controlled
- changes along with independant var
## Control Group
- the group that gets "0" level of the I.V
- used as basis of comparision
## Experimental Groups
- control + experimental group should always be = to one another in everyway except of the I.V
- **Extrenuous variable is also a confounding variable**

## I.V can be: 
1. Manipulated
    - you can randomly assign s; the experimenter creates the situation 
2. Subject Variable 
    - refers to already existing characteristics of S
    - you must **Select** S~s~
    - you **can't** randomly assign S~s~
    - you cannot infer cause & effect
    - you **can** state that the groups performed differently.

**_Not true experiment is called quasi experiment_**

## Validity
1. Statiscal conclusion validity
2. Construct validity 
3. External validity
    - the degree to which results generalize
4. Internal Validity    
    - you can infer cause & effect
    - no flaws/no confounding variables/independant cause & effect

pre-test | treatment | post-test
---------|-----------|----------
80|           | 65 (treatment is effective)
80| control condition | 80 (to be expected)

**note: a control condition is rarely used**

## History
- something that happens in between pre-test and post-test, i.e losing job between would result in lower anxiety score

## Maturation
- subject matured in between pre-test & post-test

## Regression to the mean
- when S~s~ are selected because they score extremely high or extremely low on some characterisitc, their socres tend to change in directon of the mean, when they're re-tested.
- example: 
    - a high pre-test = low post-test
    - low pre-test = high post-test
