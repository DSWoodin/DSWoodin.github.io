Are you often feeling like the days run into each other and homeschooling feels overwhelming more often than not? There will always be overwhelming, hard days in homeschooling, but there are definitely ways to simplify your homeschool life to reduce some overwhelm. I'll be sharing with you how this one quote can help simplify your homeschool life.

### Focus on your values and priorites to simplify your homeschool life

Applying this to homeschool life, this may take a bit of time, but really diving in and discovering the essential for your homeschool life is so key. And starting from a place of [values and priorities for your family](https://www.simplehomemom.com/how-to-create-a-family-motto-based-on-your-values-in-three-steps/) is a great place to start. For instance, we value getting outside and reading aloud, so we make sure that's apart of our homeschool. A book that greatly impacted my homeschooling journey in the beginning was the book [_Teaching From Rest_](https://cathyduffyreviews.com/homeschool-extras/parent-helps-and-how-to-books/general-parent-helps/teaching-from-rest-a-homeschooler-s-guide-to-unshakable-peace). I linked that for you in my Amazon shops ([US shop](http://www.amazon.com/shop/simplehomemom) and [Canadian shop](http://www.amazon.ca/shop/simplehomemom)) if you'd like to check that out too.

### Simplify your homeschool life with this one quote

Identify the essential, elmininate the rest with the [homeschool clutter](https://www.inspirethemom.com/2021/01/04/how-to-successfully-declutter-your-homeschool/) (Jessica has a great blog on the homeschool clutter!). Take a look at your supplies and books on hand. Is it all used, loved, needed? Do you have far too much? Decluttering your homeschool space will go far in simplifying your homeschool life and lead to peaceful, tidier days. We have toddlers and preschoolers here, so focusing less has saved my sanity many times ha!
