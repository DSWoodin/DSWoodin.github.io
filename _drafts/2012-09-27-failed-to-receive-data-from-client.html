<div><br/><div><strong>Title:  </strong>Backup fails in the middle of the job with the error below "E8535 Failed to receive data from the client agent. (ADDRESS= (DNS (IP Address)), EC=code, COMMAND=0"</div><br/><div><br/><br/><strong>Description:</strong><br/><br/>The universal client agent is a component which can be called by various clients such as client agent for windows, exchange agent and so on and its services are shared. Now this can be accomplished in 2 approaches.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>In process component.</li><br/></ul><br/></div><br/><ul><br/>	<li>Out process component.</li><br/></ul><br/>An in-process component is implemented as a DLL, and runs in the same process as its client application, enabling the most efficient communication between client and component. Each client application that uses the component starts a new instance of it.<br/><br/>An out-of-process component is implemented as an EXE, and unlike a DLL, runs in its own process space making the communication between client and component marshaled across the process boundaries. A single instance of an out of process component can service many clients.<br/><br/>The calling approach is environmental specific and can specify the approach to be used in the application.<br/><br/>In Arcserve application, the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ComputerAssociates\CA Arcserve Backup\UniversalClientAgent\Options specifies the various clients that can call Universal client agent component.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>\Options\1000 --- Client Agent for windows<br/>\Options\2000\1070 --- Oracle Agent<br/>\Options\2000\1400 --- SQL Agent<br/>\Options\1060 --- Exchange Agent for Document level.<br/><br/>You can get this information from registry.<br/><br/>Go to \options sub key, highlight any folder within the sub key (For example 1000), you would see an registry value product name, which gives the name of client agent. Now the registry value "Executable" within sub key 1000 specifies the way universal client component is being called by the clients. With the value set to '0' it will run the component in 'in process mode'. The value set to '1' will run the component process in 'out of process mode'.<br/><br/>The above error may be resolved by changing the approach the universal client component is being called by various clients due to environmental specifications.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This article contains information about modifying the registry.<br/><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Before you modify the registry, make sure to create a backup of the registry and ensure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem may occur.</span><br/>For more information about how to backup, restore, edit the registry, please review the relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base articles on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">support.microsoft.com</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Solution:</strong><br/><br/><em><strong>This error is not specific to client agent for windows only; you can see this error for exchange agent, SQL agent and so on.</strong></em><br/><br/>If the client agent for windows is failing with the above error, go to the registry key<br/><br/>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ComputerAssociates\CA Arcserve Backup\UniversalClientAgent\Options\1000<br/><br/>change the value of 'Executable' from 0 to 1 or vice versa.<br/><br/>The sub keys for other agents are:<br/><br/>\Options\2000\1070 --- Oracle Agent<br/>\Options\2000\1400 --- SQL Agent<br/>\Options\1060 --- Exchange Agent for Document level<br/><br/><em><strong>If the issue is not resolved, you may revert the changes.</strong></em><br/><div><a href="https://support.ca.com/irj/portal/anonymous/kbtech?searchID=TEC475333&amp;docid=475333&amp;bypass=yes&amp;fromscreen=kbresults" target="_blank">https://support.ca.com/irj/portal/anonymous/kbtech?searchID=TEC475333&amp;docid=475333&amp;bypass=yes&amp;fromscreen=kbresults</a></div><br/></div>
