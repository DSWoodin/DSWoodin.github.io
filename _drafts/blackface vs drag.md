# blackface vs drag

https://youtu.be/HTBxHvnRWts

why is it socially acceptable for men to
put on dresses makeup and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype but it is not socially acceptable for a white person to put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African Americans? shouldn't both be okay or
neither?

on the surface yeah there are similarities between blackface and drag

they're both one group posing as another group
they both rely on exaggerated stereotypes and 
they're both over-the-top caricatures

but blackface is inherently racist you can't take the racism out of it drag on the other hand you can easily separate from misogyny most drag in fact almost all drag is about strong powerful admirable female characters. 

with blackface black people are the butt of the joke but with drag it's not women who are the butt of the joke but rules about gender roles nobody looks at a drag queen and things oh yeah that's what real women are actually like the way that a lot of Americans did with
black face and minstrel shows and

there's something else going on with
drag unlike stock minstrel characters
drag performers are a personal
expression of the performer drag queens
aren't just imitating female stereotypes
they're expressing how fluid their own
gender can be that's why a performers
drag name and drag family and drag
costume are so important to them

blackface performers on the other hand
aren't expressing anything internal
they're not asserting their personal
racial fluidity all that blackface does is lie about what people of color are like 

now there is of course bad drag bad
drag is just a man wearing a dress not
making any effort to perform or create a
character or express anything with bad
drag the whole joke is that it
supposedly embarrassing for a man to be seen acting feminine that's not real drag. that's just ridiculing women and queers and if you want to be fancy about it perpetuating the cycle of patriarchal
hegemony that's bad

women actually perform drag
themselves even little girls perform
drag when they dress up as princesses
these are exaggerated feminine
characters an expression of the
attraction to or curiosity about gender
roles drag is how you explore who you
are or who you can become

as RuPaul says were born naked and then
the rest is drag no one has ever said
we're born naked and the rest is a
minstrel show 


that drag is an expression of yourself
and blackface is an attack on someone
else blackface reinforces an imbalance
of power and drag disassembles an
imbalance of power blackface is a relic
and drag is what we all do every day
every time we put on clothes so
