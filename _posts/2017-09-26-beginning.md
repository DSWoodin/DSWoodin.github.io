Here's the thing - I created this site three months ago with the intention of writting my first blog post to explain exactly how to get this pretty complicated process off the ground (at least for me as a total novice with respect to HTML, GitHub, and computer programming in general). Then life happened and I had to leave the weekend's work behind; which is to say I didn't write any of it down, which was the **ENTIRE POINT** of writing this first post.  This led me to having to go back through a few of the scattered bits of files I had created to figure out what I had done in the first place, which is to say the three following statements:  

`THIS SITE IS FOR YOU IF YOU HAPHAZARDLY FORGET USEFUL INFO ALL THE TIME` 

`THIS SITE IS FOR YOU IF YOU ARE SCARED OF INCORPORATING TECH IN A CLASS SETTING`

`THIS SITE IS FOR YOU IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO MAKE LIFE EASIER, ALBEIT BY PUTTING IN A BIT MORE WORK UPFRONT`

So how will this all work? ...

The layout, as mentioned on the [Home page](https://devonorourke.github.io/) is really simple: 
1. There's a page where I'll introduce the topic we're dealing with in a blog format - like the very one you're reading right now - under the [Learning](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page. In some instances the entirety of the post will be self contained (read: if it's really simple). In other cases I might write a short blog outlining the basic premise of the project but then link to a separate page where the gory details are provided in full - specifically, you'll find these longer posts under the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/teaching/) page. For example, if you're interested in how to build a website like this one from scratch, I've documented [that process here]**(??? link ???)**.  

2. There's a [Doing](https://devonorourke.github.io/doing/) page where I'll provide overviews about the science I've been involved with. Interested in experimental evolution of microbial communities? Me too! How about white nose syndrom and the genetics of adaptation? Also me too! How about poop!? Not so much? Well I think it can be pretty useful. It's my hope to share as much of the techniques and results as I can in a detailed yet approachable way.

3. As mentioned in the first point, you'll find the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page particularly useful for extensive documentation outlining how do do a process introduced in a blog. Buyer beware - code changes quick, so be sure to take not of when the post was written as things may have changed (possibly substantially).  

I always appreciate feedback so feel free to [get a hold of me](devon.orourke@gmail.com) if you have a comment.  

Thanks for visiting!
