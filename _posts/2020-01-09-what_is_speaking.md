As far as What I wrote multiple times on this blog, Currently I'm focusing on speaking English. To be as fluent as I want to be, I should have defined `What is fluent speaking` in my mind.
Naturally, I've never heard that My Korean is fluent. We usually say it to those who speak a second language. If someone speaking English as mother language would say 'Your English is fluent.', It means My English is heard to a native clearly.

Basically Speaking is delivering my idea to the listener. This is not only for English but also for Korean.  Someone's speaking is clear means She or he selects legitimate words and speaks with good intonation and organized sentence structure. It's a good point. Even If I make a bad sentence structure or using improper words in Korean, I never heard my Korean is not fluent. But In case of English is different. If I don't choose proper words or non-logical sentence, They say It's because of not being fluent.

So now I'm not only learning English but also Logical sentence structure and how to use proper words. I think It's quite helpful for speaking Korean too.
