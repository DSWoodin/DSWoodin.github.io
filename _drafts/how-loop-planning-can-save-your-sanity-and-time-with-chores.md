Have you felt extremely stressed out by trying to keep up with all things in your home? There are so many things, no matter what size your home or family is, so [loop planning](https://pambarnhill.com/loop-scheduling/#:\~:text=Loop%20scheduling%20doesn't%20assign,the%20list%20and%20start%20there.) is one strategy that help you keep track of it all in a way that can be very low stress, too. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you **how to make chores simple with loop planning**.

## So what's loop planning?

**A loop plan is essentially a list of things or tasks that you loop through, with no regard to time.** That way you never feel behind or ahead, you know?

### Why loop planning?

Loop planning is a fantastic strategy to use with home planning if you want to be consistent, but also don’t want to burn out. There are endless uses for loop planning with managing your home. I originally heard about [loop planning](https://pambarnhill.com/loop-scheduling/#:\~:text=Loop%20scheduling%20doesn't%20assign,the%20list%20and%20start%20there.) in the homeschooling world. My personal favourite is using a loop planning strategy for those "extra chores". I share about my loop chore routine [in my Instagram stories](www.instagram.com/simplehomemom) as well as you can grab my free chore routine printables, including my loop plan in the related blog below.

#### LOOP PLANNING EXAMPLES: CHORES

_Here is one example of a loop plan that is focused on cleaning zones:_

**How I organize my chore loop plan for those extra chores:**

* I have a list of areas that I want to work on
* I created a master task list to refer to whenever I'm in each area (such as laundry room - wipe windows, vacuum behind washer and so on).
* Currently I go through the loop on Monday-Thursday.
* I decide what I want to do when I'm working on an area and then move on when I'm done (whenever that happens to be). I worked on the master bedroom windows and decluttering a couple things this week in my closet! Sometimes I'm just focusing on cleaning or just decluttering. I decide what to do each day in my loop chore area. Right now I'm doing it all because the house really needs it all (organizing, maintenance decluttering, cleaning).

### Other loop planning ideas: chores

You can also do loop chores by ACTIVITY such as with: mopping, vacuuming, dusting or with cleaning toilets, cleaning the tub, cleaning the windows, mopping the floor (repeat). The options are completely endless with loop planning, but I love using my area method because it's easy to keep track of and I can prioritize what needs to be done each time. I can go through quickly or slowly depending on what mood or season of life I'm in.

_I promise you that loop planning becomes easier with practice too!_
