In lesson 2, we learned about IDEs, Terminals, different Workflows, and gained more in-depth knowledge about Git.

**Warning:** Important Information Below

An IDE is an integrated development environment. IDEs allow us to edit code, build automation, and debug. Visual Studio Code, also known as VS Code, is an IDE that can support multiple languages. VS Code was made by Microsoft and supports debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. VS Code is a widely used IDE and the one that I have used most.

Terminals allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface and instead using a command-line interface. This pretty much means that for example, if you want to access a folder or create a new file, you don't have to go clicking around. The terminal that I have used most is the Command Prompt application provided by Windows. I also use the terminal in VS Code. 

Workflows allow for organization and overall manage production. Workflows can span all stages of production, including planning, developing, testing, and deployment and iteration. Workflows can be created in VS Code, Shell, and Git.

We also learned about branches in Git. This ties into workflows, as when you create a workflow, different branches are created for organization purposes. Branches also allow different people to work on code without overlapping someone else and creating a mess. 

Coming into this lesson, I had briefly used the terminal. I had worked in VS Code before and I had used Git a little as well. I enjoyed working in the terminal and realized it wasn't as scary as I had initially thought. My VS Code and Git skills were enhances from this lesson as well.
