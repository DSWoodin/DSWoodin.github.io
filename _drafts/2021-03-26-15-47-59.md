I enforce federal worker health and safety and pollution regulations. 

When i was learning my trade, when my classmates and were having a chuckle over the "well duh" level of specificity written into the Code of Federal Regulations (try "no hazardous material shall be stored in crew berthing" on for size), I Will never forget the silence that followed when our instructor these words: 

"Your regulations are written in blood."

These regulations were not written on a whim. They were written because someone thought they could cut costs by storing however many more pounds of a radioactive: toxic, carcinogenic, or whatever else material in the same rooms where the human beings they paid to transport those materials slept and then did that, because no one was telling them not to. 

They were written because people died. Horrifically. Because unregulated capitalism values profit over human life and suffering.

Can I say it again, for those not paying attention? 

Unregulated capitalism values profit over human life and suffering.

I'm a human volunteer content transcriber for Reddit and you could be too! If you'd like more information on what we do and why we do it, click here



The school is the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the original quote is "The books of safety were written in the blood of sailors." (Paraphrase from 50 years ago in Surface Warfare)!
