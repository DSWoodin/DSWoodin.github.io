 A woman who claims to have lived through and remembers very well multiple "reality snaps", where reality suddenly dissolves and rebuilds itself in such a way that everyone believes that was the way reality always was, kidnaps a pair of college roommates and forces them to help her discover why this happens and how to stop it.

The woman is right, but she's also completely insane and has a lot of violent tendencies which make the roommates reluctant to believe her.

I've only got the premise down; there WAS a whole plot for it and everything, but it's stupid.
