## Projects
***
### 1. Face Mask Detection
In this project I'm building a Face mask detector that detects whether a person is wear a mask or not. Also published a peper on this task. It's really important for this current Covid-19 situation. I've share a you-tube video of my project which is given below.

### 3. Crop vs Weed Detection 
In this project I'm building a weed detector that detects whether a weed is present in agriculture field or not(seems fancy). It's really important for agricultural purpose. I'll share a you-tube video of this project soon.. Stay tuned

### 4. Sentiment analysis Of online Food Review
This is a part of research. Soon avalilable.
### 5. Bert for Amazon Movie Review
Soon open source..
