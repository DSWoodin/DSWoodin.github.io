# A charity stream for Velocity Sloth Mom & Family
We at Fur Squared have volunteered to help with our developing tech chops to put on a little charity stream for Velocity Sloth Mom & Family.  On December 17th, Velocity lost her husband, Don, to covid-19, and he was the sole provider for her and their two daughters.
