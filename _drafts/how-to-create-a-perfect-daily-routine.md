Creating a perfect daily routine. Is there really such a thing as a _perfect daily routine_? There is no perfection in life, but a good planned daily routine can be very life-giving and something to come back to over and over. I've found this to be true over and over again during my years of being a mom and having a daily routine. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about **how to create a perfect daily routine**. I hope it helps you out today and gives you some ideas to create or tweak your own routines. And make sure to scroll down to receive your FREE printable daily planner sheet too!

### My journey with a daily routine as a mom

I didn't really have any consistent routine in place probably until I had a third kid. I think at that point it became more necessary as my kids became older too. Before then, we had our meal times, quiet times, and bedtimes instilled, but not much outside of that for myself or the kids. It was really just all over the place in many ways. As I took time to declutter LINKKKKK our home years back, it was the start of something wonderful for myself and our home life. Over time, I came to see that the time I spent during the day wasn't really the best spent. I was letting life happen far too often for us without being very intentional with that time. That's when I started to create simple daily routines for the family and myself LINK. It eventually led to me creating my first morning routine. You can read about some of my early morning routines on a few of my blogs [here](https://www.simplehomemom.com/tags/#morning%20routine%20with%20kids).

### Three steps to create the perfect daily routine:

1. Take note about what you do daily for a few days. What do you want to keep? What do you want to do less of? What would you like to add? What did you notice?
2. Jot down some of your values and goals for your daily routine. Such as: reading more consistently, taking quiet time, or making time for friends.
3. Work towards your perfect daily routine day by day. And give yourself lots of time and grace as you are changing old habits and instilling new ones.

And always come back to your values. Ask why you are doing your daily routine in the first place whenever you feel the motivation waning. Reassess, change things up as needed and keep going! Related BLOG here.

Sidebar: even though I am sharing about the perfect daily routine, there really isn't such a thing. I'm often tweaking our routines to meet the needs of the family and myself! Recently, I'm reading a book to help me to even more carve out some new routines that I want to put in. I find writing things up in a brainstorm and then time blocking them to be very helpful...and having a spot to put them in if they're more periodic - such as weekly or monthly.
