Nepal should be the most ‘spiritual’ country in the world. Everything is sacred here- the forest, rock, river, land, air, spirits, month, day; and what else? When kids urinate in the open, they say biraye biraye– meaning I did a great mistake, god please forgive me.
Many places in Nepal have Naag ko (S)Than. Naag is the snake-god. Every snake is considered as god in Nepal, and no one should kill a snake. Naag ko S(Than) means place of snake- home of snakes. One should not mess up with snake’s home.

When one uses a bridge over the river, they chant Vishnu Vishnu. Vishnu is one of the trinities in Hindu religion.

Many Nepalese worship Kul Devata. These deities are the origins of the patrilineages. Nepalese also summon vaayu (ancestral spirits who left physical body in no age) in their own bodies during special ceremonies.

In Newari culture, they have been continuing the stories, dance, music, Jatras (parades of Gods, Goddesses, and other supernaturals), and other traditions. You might be surprised that places where Newars live have significant number of the temples of Devis, Ganeshas, and other Hindu deities.

The months of Shrawan and Bhadra are Fupu-Bhadai (paternal aunt – a woman’s brother’s daughter). These months fall during the peak summer monsoon and the end of the same. While the month of Shrawan is the paternal aunt, the month of Bhadra is the niece. The common saying is that when Shrawan ends and Bhadra starts, there is intense rain (symbolic of emotional crying).

The month of Shrawan is also called as Lord Shiva’s month. A special month when women commit themselves to religious devotion expecting good health of husband and children.

Most Nepalese offer honorary food to Vaayu and Kul Devata when something special is made in their kitchens. Every year, they perform Shraddha as homage and food to deceased parent, or grandparent (Pitri). The lunar day of death of the deceased parent or grandparent is noted so that Shraddha can be performed on same day, every year. If a child who has survived some years dies, Shraddha is done by parent every year. Shraddhas are done by members of patrilineages. A married daughter joins the patrilineage of her husband when she leaves her patrilineage.

Time has 4 yugas in Hindu religion- Satya, Treta, Dwapar, and Kali. We are currently living in Kali yuga. This is meant to end with a destruction.

Nepalese believe in extraterrestrial. The spirits and the gods are believed to stay ET, yet put eye on the mortal world. They believe in the voyage from land to satyaloka– meaning extraterrestrial space; and the reverse.
