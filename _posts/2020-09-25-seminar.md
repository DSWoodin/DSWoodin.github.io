## Abstract

A major uncertainty in the determination of the mass profile of the Milky
Way using stellar kinematics is the poorly determined anisotropy parameter,
beta = 1 - ( ( (sigma_theta)**2 + (sigma_phi)**2 ) / ( 2 * (sigma_r)**2 ),
where sigma_r is the Galactocentric radial velocity dispersion, and
sigma_theta and sigma_phi are the tangential components of the velocity
dispersion. We use a sample of over 22,000 Galactic halo K giant and blue
horizontal branch stars from the ground-based LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE stellar
spectroscopic surveys, combined with proper motions from the space telescope
Gaia, to measure beta(r) over a wide range of Galactocentric distances r
from 4 to 100 kpc. We investigate the extent to which a much improved
knowledge of beta influences the determination of the Galactic mass profile
M(r) as a function of r.

## Bio

Dr. Sarah A. Bird received her Ph.D. from the University of Turku in
Finland in 2014, upon which she began as a LAMOST Fellow at the Shanghai
Astronomical Observatory and later continued as a PIFI Postdoctoral Fellow.
In 2018 she moved to NAOC in Beijing with the Aliyun Fellowship.
Her research focuses on the stellar halos of the Milky Way and other
galaxies which she investigates using both observations and simulations.

Everyone is welcome to participate!
