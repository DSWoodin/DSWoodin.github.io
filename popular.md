* SO excited to partner with [Knix](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101leRdT). I have had one of their bras for a few years now and am in love. It still looks brand new and is the comfiest bra I've ever owned. I value high quality + pieces that will last a long, long time so feel comfortable partnering with them. I have plans to add their [shelf tank](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101leRdT) to my capsule wardrobe soon too and can't wait to share about it. You can also receive $10 off your first order with the code **knix10**.
