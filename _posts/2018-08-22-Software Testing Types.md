Nowadays anyone can name hundreds of types in software testing. Of course, all of them have the right to survive and to work with. The various techniques and methods that you use to thoroughly verify software or application have a specific purpose behind each type of testing technique.

It is not necessary to know the definition of all testing types. but here we will know about some of the most commonly used testing types.

# Black-box testing

Black box testing is a test technique that focuses on the output rather than on the internal processes of the system. This is also called functional testing.

# White box testing

White box testing takes into account the internal processes of a system. This is also called structural testing or glass box testing.

# GreyBox Testing

Greybox testing is a software testing method to test the software application with partial knowledge of the internal working structure. It is a combination of black box and white box testing because it involves access to internal coding to design test cases as white box testing and testing practices are done at functionality level as black box testing.

# Functional testing

The function of functional testing is to ensure that the application and all its functions work properly as per the business requirements and qualify for the software specification. Its primary purpose is to verify that the output provided by each application function matches the expectation.

# Non-Functional Testing

It is a reverse to functional testing, to test non-functional parameters such as reliability, load test, performance and accountability of the software. Non-functional testing is also very important as functional testing because it plays a crucial role in customer satisfaction.

For example, non-functional testing would be to test how many people can work simultaneously on any software.

# Positive Testing

It is another essential testing technique used to show a software product or an application under the test. It validates how the application performs for the positive set of data. In this type of testing, we will enter the valid data set as the input value.

# Negetive Testing

It is a unique type of software testing technique used to evaluate the system for unpredicted circumstances. It plays a very significant role in high-performance software development.

In this testing, the system is authorized by giving the invalid data as input. A negative test analyzed if an application performs as predictable with its negative inputs.

# Ad-hoc testing

This type of software testing is absolutely informal and un-structural. No test case or test document is required to handle this. Tests can be performed on any stakeholder without any reference.
Ad-hoc testing is usually done by those who have a good idea about the domain and workflow of the software application. Through this test it is possible to find out all the flaws that exist in the software which are not found in the use of test cases.

# Exploratory testing

Exploratory testing is an unwritten testing technique that focuses on the tester's autonomy and creativity. This is a hands-on approach where the tester is more involved in the implementation than the test plan. Exploratory testing is used to detect unknown problems during and after the software development process. In particular, the tester may apply this type of test to detect certain bugs, providing information on the design of future functional and regression tests.

# Regression testing

When a program is modified, the old things still work properly with the new changes seen through the regression test. Before the release of a new version of a software product, all the old capabilities are still in place to ensure that the old test cases are run in the new version. The reason for doing this test is that changing the code or connecting can easily cause errors in the program and interrupt the work.

# System testing

System testing is the process of installing software in a variety of environments (for example operating systems) to make sure it actually works. System testing is completed with complete system implementation and environment. It belongs to the black box testing class.
There are two types of testing, functional and non-functional.

# Acceptance testing

Customers often undergo acceptance testing to ensure that the software product provided meets their needs and expectations. It belongs to the black-box test class.
This type of test is usually performed to verify that the system meets customer-specific requirements.

Alpha and beta testing are two more types of testing that have become popular in modern times.

# Alpha Testing

This is a type of acceptance testing that is done before the product is released to the customer. Usually, QA tests are done by a team, while software testing is done internally within the organization.

# Beta testing

Beta testing is testing that is done by the end-user, a team outside of development, or a pre-released version of a product known as a beta version. The goal of beta testing is to fix unexpected errors. It belongs to the black-box test class. When software testing is done for a limited number of people.

All types of tests can be further divided into two types. That is positive testing and negative testing.
In a positive testing approach, only positive things are considered, that is, checking whether the system is doing what it is supposed to do.
Negative testing works the opposite of what the system should not do.
