Hi. Welcome!

I'm Marvellous. My friends call me Mahveo, Mahveotm, tm or simply Marv. 

Currently, I work for a small health startup as an automation(Infastructure as Code) engineer. I have previously worked as an independent contractor for a couple of other coys including Netflix, Gluu, Grizzly & WF. 

I am particularly intrested in Ops, Cloud architecture, arts & Nigerian politics. 

I also volunteer with the Wikimedia project & genius.com - where I annotate music mostly Afrobeats. 


Talk to me about anything. I have a particularly impressive range and just enjoy listening to people talk about what they're passionate about. 

See you around. 

'Rv.

My name is Marv. I have the following great qualities!

I'm not short!

I extreemly loyal to friends!

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my favorite movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King) and it will answer **all** your questions!
