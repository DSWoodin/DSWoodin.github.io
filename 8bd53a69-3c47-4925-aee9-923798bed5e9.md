 Totally agree. Spent 2 weeks in Norway a few years ago. The western coast was absolutely stunning. I absolutely loved Bergen. We stayed in Odda and did the Trolltunga hike at 5 AM and that was incredible. Spent a day and night in Geiranger. Kayaked in the Nærøyfjord. 

I definitely enjoyed the west coast of Norway over Oslo any day.
