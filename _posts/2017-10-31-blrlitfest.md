Literary festivals have intrigued me right from when I attended my first Jaipur Literature Festival in 2014. Since then, I have kept track of every major litfest in the country, and also founded a litfest in Pilani (cutely named _Papyrus Trails_). How could I then resist attending the [Bangalore Literature Festival](http://bangaloreliteraturefestival.org/) on 28th and 29th October?

Before I start writing about the individual sessions, a few notes on the organization of the festival itself :-

# Notes 

* I was surprised to find that BLR LitFest was wholly crowdfunded. That is awesome. The theme of the festival was 'Speak Up and Speak Out'

* The venue (Hotel Lalit Ashok) was just the right size. It was decorated and maintained pretty well too. There were three main venues - #speakup, #speakout and The Red Couch. There was also a dedicated Children's venue (which IMO is a masterstroke).

* The sessions ran on time, save for a ~ 15 minute delay at #speakout on Day 1 (which sort of worked for me - more on this later).

* The crowd though was not as cultured as Jaipur (see the irony there?). The Bangalore elite really disappointed me. They were dirtying the place with food leftovers and beer bottles, even when there were enough waste bins around. Not done, Bangalore.

* The festival as a whole could use some small changes. There were not enough volunteers to carry around microphones, and the microphones didn't reach the audience at the back at all. I am sure there would be no dearth of volunteers (or microphones, for that matter) in a city like Bangalore.

* Also, Bangalore peeps, why do you not ask good, relevant questions to speakers? Where did your intellectualism run off too? It was a put-on, right?

* Another major problem - people keeping seats. The whole idea of hierarchy in reserving seats as well as the principles and values at play while one does that is completely antithetical to the concept of a 'free' festival. Again, not done, Bangalore.

* The food was not really good. But I don't think that did a lot of harm.

* The book store was just too cramped! Also, it is never a nice idea to have the signing booth literally beside a stage, that too in a partially closed environment. I hope this is taken care of in the future editions.

* But I know how tough this might have been to put together. So congratulations team, I had a lot of fun!

Special thanks to Mr. Varun Wachaspati J aka Wachas and Mr. Rishabh Agarwal aka Ballu for companionship during the two days!  

Now to the sessions I attended. 

# Day 1 - Saturday, 28th October

I arrived late, because I was taking my GRE Physics in the morning. Reached at about 12:45 PM.

* **Silence - The Trolls are in Session** - _Laxmi Murthy, Nidhi Razdan, Sindhu S with Ammu Joseph_
	The women spoke about how online trolls have impacted their lives, and how the harassment on social media have given rise to a feeling of wariness in their day-to-day lives. Nidhi Razdan articulated how the left and Congress trolls would only abuse the tweet itself, but the BJP trolls would go to extreme extents and project chauvinistic, jingoist views on the tweets. She also criticized Facebook for not having done much to counter the trolls, and said Twitter was much more proactive in this matter. The audience as well as the panel seemed to agree that women get trolled much more than men.

* **Whose Side are You On?** - _Gideon Haigh with Suresh Menon_
	I have been reading Gideon Haigh's writings since about two years now. He discussed how one takes sides in cricket, especially in an age when franchise cricket has sponsored. He was of the view that franchise cricket was great entertainment, but it had no recall or nostalgia value.

* **Death by Litigation - The Perils of Business Reporting** - _Josy Joseph, Maheshwar Peri, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta with Nidhi Razdan_
	Perhaps the best session I attended. Moderated beautifully. All the speakers had some really harrowing stories to share about their legal battles with corporates - Paranjoy with the Ambanis, Peri with Arindam Chaudhuri of IIPM, and Joseph with Jet Airways. Their grit and unfazed determination to hold truth to power was inspiring. Paranjoy also was of the opinion that the present government attempts at curbing media was comparable to the times of Ememrgency. Also had the first glance of an _Old Uncle_ who made multiple appearances in further Q&A sessions, and had some really useless comments and questions.

* **Indira** - _Sagarika Ghose with Paranjoy Guha Thakurta_
	Sagarika Ghose spoke on her new book on Indira Gandhi. Was a so-so session peppered with some headline-worthy one-liners like "Narendra Modi is Indira's true political heir" and "Indira was the only man in the Government". Also discovered that _Old Uncle_ was a Congress worker in his younger days and a big Indira lover.

* **This Is My Story** - _Savi Sharma with Varun Agarwal_
	We attended this only so that we would have seats for the next talk. Won't comment, but didn't have a very good opinion of Savi Sharma's literary prowess from her speech.

* **How Indiaâ€™s T20 World Cup Win Changed Indian and World Cricket** - _Anil Kumble, Gideon Haigh, Rajdeep Sardesai with Sharda Ugra_
	Look at that panel! Certainly a highlight of day 1. The session seemed to take off from where Gideon's earlier session had ended. A very erudite discussion aside, the highlight of the session was Kumble being sarcastic towards Rajdeep for not including enough bowlers in his _Democracy's XI_ and Rajdeep in return naggingly making comments such as "All questions related to Kohli should be directed to Anil" and asking Kumble "Let's get a headline out of you -Would you be willing to be the Indian coach again?"

* **From Page to Screen** - _Baradwaj Rangan, MK Raghavendra, Sanjoy Hazarika with Ravi Gupta_
	This panel dealt with the issues involved in adapting literature for the big screen. A brilliant, erudite set of panelists destroyed by a pathetic moderator. Ravi Gupta tried to hog too much limelight, and said stupid things like "JK Rowling wrote the later books knowing they would be made into movies and they were better movies." Utter bullshit. But the other panelists, especially Rangan and Raghavendra spoke brilliantly. The session did create a lot of questions in my mind, one of them being "If a short story is more suitable to be adapted on to the big screen, is the novel best suited for TV?" Though I didn't get to ask the question during the session, I had a long 40-minute discussion about this with Rangan after the session.

That was the end of Day 1. Had a heavy dinner at Empire Restaurant in Majestic with Wachas.

# Day 2 - Sunday, 29th October
