 Men are told not to share their emotions and insecurities in public or with friends, only with parents and their partner. Women, on the other hand, often openly share their vulnerabilities with friends. So, when they treat their male friend as such, this person may interpret it as romantic advances, since society teaches them that these emotions are reserved for their partner. As a result, it may feel like they have been "led on". It's often a misunderstanding, really, that roots in sexism and oppression.

Women are objectified, as a result, and men feel less worthy as a human being based on that perceived rejection. It's a prime example of how society's toxic concept of masculinity works.
