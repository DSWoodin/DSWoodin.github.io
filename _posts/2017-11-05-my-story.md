Many people ask me why I changed my profession and what was my path. I would like to share my story 🙂 And check emoji’s: ➡️ 🐍

Python Developer / [DjangoGirlsWaw](https://www.facebook.com/DjangoGirlsWarsaw/) PyLight
 co-organiser / Green Roofs Enthusiast

Green Roofs are my passion. My friends know, that I can talk about them a lot and sometimes it's not easy to stop me 😉 In the middle of creating green roofs map to my master thesis at Poznan University of Economics, I crossed the issue of moving my map from Google Maps to CartoDB. Data layers were based on Google's sattellite images. CartoDB had another geospatial source and the angles of photo shots were different. Not 'the same kind of vector' different but unlike to Google's in each place.

This is when I met programming for the first time - to tranfer my layers automatically I had to use JavaScript. This is how my story begun. I started first tutorials and found out, that I really enjoy doing these smaller and bigger 'logical puzzles'. After some time I decided that I could be a full time programmer. 
First decision was: _Front-end or back-end - that is the question?_ 

As a landscape architect I heard many times from my friends (instead of one, whom I will mention soon 🙂), that I should do front-end. And so I did, I started with front-end. I finished some courses on Coursera, watched video tutorials, started coding first websites. But there was 'no chemistry' between me and HTML&CSS. Maybe it's werid, but in some way it reminded me too much of landscape architecture. And I realized, I'm done with moving things a little bit from here to there and changing colors to little brighter and so on. 

Then I turned to advice of one of my friends, Michał, who already recommended me to start with Python weeks before. And this was it. When I started Python tutorials I felt enchanted 🐍 I missed logical mind tricks, which I solved tons of between my primary and high school on Oddysey of the Mind classes. And I felt very similiar with Python - logical sequences exercising brain (especially in the beginning when everything is brand new).

I would like to thank:  
  Bartek whose love and joyful support lead me to where am I ❤️  
  Michał, who believed in me more then I did and was the greatest motivator ever 🚀  
  Maja and Mikołaj who are the precious friends in the world 😘  
  Asia who is inspiring Back-End Developer 👩‍💻  
  Maciej for explaining me IT paths and drawing 'the tree of technologies' 🌳  
  Krzysiek for conversation about IT world during sunny september day ☀️  
  and CartoDB for their sattellite photos source 😉
