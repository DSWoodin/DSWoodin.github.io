 * Atleast a part of the Constituent Assembly Debates (they are available [online](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/debates.htm), and Ambedkar's speech introducing the structure of the draft Constitution and it's goals is  [here](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p1b.htm). (Do ctrl+f for the phrase "Mr. President, Sir, I introduce the Draft Constitution" and start reading there. It's a great introduction to the Constitution, which is the basic law of this country. If you're looking for background and context in the form of an easy, readable history, then Granville Austin's [The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5385816-the-indian-constitution?from_search=true) and [Working a Democratic Constitution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3728126-working-a-democratic-constitution?from_search=true) are must-reads. 

* P Sainath's [Everybody Loves a Good Drought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/547573.Everybody_Loves_a_Good_Drought): If you want to understand how most of India lives, then this is a fundamental book. It is the best rural reporter we have, telling stories that are usually not heard. His journalism has been collected in this book as a series of essays. In a similar vein, Aman Sethi's [A Free Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13707595-a-free-man?from_search=true) is also worth reading. 

* Nehru's [The Discovery of India](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154126.The_Discovery_of_India?from_search=true) is worth reading, not because it tells you the history of India, but because it tells you Nehru's vision of India. Whether you agree or disagree, this vision shaped India through much of our early years. And frankly how will know if you agree or disagree unless you've read the book. Relying on ELI5s and TL:DRs and other people's summaries will only take you so far and no further. 

* Ambedkar's [Annihilation of Caste](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8521879-the-annihilation-of-caste?from_search=true) is absolutely essential reading. If you haven't understood the breadth of his genius and compassion from the Constituent Assembly Debates, then you will now. The treatment of the so-called lower castes has been India's shame, and continues to be our shame. This analysis comes right to the root of it and is still relevant. It can be read with Gail Omvedt's account of his life [Ambedkar: Towards an Enlightened India](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2639898-ambedkar?from_search=true) 

* Bhagat Singh's [Jail Notebooks and Other Writings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3334037-the-jail-notebook-and-other-writings?ac=1&from_search=true) - I don't think I need to exolain why, but I will point out that actually reading this book shows how most political groups that claim his legacy actually disagree with most of what he is saying. 

* For ancient history, the best introductions for non-specialists in my opinion are AL Basham's [The Wonder That Was India](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/631246.The_Wonder_That_Was_India?from_search=true) vol 1 (until the Mughals) and SA Rizvi's [vol 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1986748.The_Wonder_That_Was_India?from_search=true) (Mughal period to British conquest). 

* For post-Independence history, most non-specialists would recommend Ramachandra Guha's [India After Gandhi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/356824.India_After_Gandhi?ac=1&from_search=true). In addition you can add all of Srinath Raghavan's books on contemporary military history: W[ar and Peace in Modern India: A Strategic History of the Nehru Years](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7749528-war-and-peace-in-modern-india?from_search=true), [India's War: World War II and the Making of Modern South Asia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26240787-india-s-war?from_search=true), and [1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17889783-1971)

* Can't read Indian history without reading Gandhi -apart from his own books, the most accessible books if you ask me are Charles DiSalvo [The Man Before the Mahatma](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16085028-the-man-before-the-mahatma?from_search=true) (account of his legal career), and any of Judith M. Brown's several books about Gandhi's political career in India. 

* All of these accounts of history tend to downplay the role of women, which is not surprising given the role of women in Indian society. To remedy this gap, I would suggest either [Women In India: A Social And Cultural History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7645108-women-in-india?from_search=true) by Sita Raman, or Radha Kumar's [The History of Doing: An Illustrated Account of Movements for Women's Rights and Feminism in India, 1800-1990](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2046554.The_History_of_Doing?from_search=true)
