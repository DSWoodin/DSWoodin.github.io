 And the worst thing is they purposely don't learn since then that means they may get assigned more responsibility! Act dumb so that the wife just gives up on asking you to do anything. 

As much as I want to get married and have kids, I do NOT want a man child! Honestly I can't even imagine having sex with someone like that - if you see them as another child there is zero physical attraction there. No wonder middle aged men always complain that the sex "decreased" over time in their marriage. Probably because the wife is tired, emotionally drained, and sees you as another baby to raise.
