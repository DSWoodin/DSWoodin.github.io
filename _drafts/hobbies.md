[[self_care]]
 Same!! Although to be honest I think I stopped my hobbies/goals because I needed to always be “available” to him. He gave me so little attention and so little actual quality time that I was desperate for ANY time with him. I didn’t realize at the time but I literally just needed to feel loved by him that I needed to make sure anything else came last. My whole self-esteem was riding on how much time he wanted to spend together. 

But even the time we did spend together barely satisfied me because he never made me feel truly appreciated or I felt ignored half the time. I don’t know how my self-esteem got so dependent on someone who didn’t treat me well anyway. Argh never again!
