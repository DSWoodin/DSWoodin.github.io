There’s a joke on Twitter that’s something like “sure he can quote leftist policy, but does he do the dishes” and tbh it is SO spot on. For so many (esp white) dudes being progressive really is mostly theoretical, because they’re not harmed by the alternative as much as women or POC or LGBTQ+ folks. So yeah, he can say all the right things, but when it comes down to it, does he put his money where his mouth is?
