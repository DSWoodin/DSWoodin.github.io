I've been pet sitting for years, mostly for half-a-dozen long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.

I
and it's still (mostly) a pleasure. Half a dozen "regulars" use my have years of experience sitting animals.


For Pet Sitting I charge Â£30 per day or part of day. This includes:
 - sleep overnight in your house using our own bedding
 - ensure that one of us stays with your pet for most of the day
 - walk dogs twice a day
 - provide our own food
 - leave your house in the same state we found it

I have half-a-dozen "regulars" who use this service. Some have been with me for years. I can only sit one house at a time and may be continuously booked so please contact me well ahead to increase the chances of getting a slot.

I always look after pets in their own homes. I'm not a Dog Walker and am not able to take pets into my home.

Because I can only sit one house at a time and am sometimes continuously booked, please contact me well in advance.
