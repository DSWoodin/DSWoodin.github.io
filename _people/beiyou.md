# Bio

Dr. Bei You got his PhD in Shanghai Observatory in 2014. The main aspect for his PhD study was the disk-corona accretion theory in BH X-ray binary and AGN, and the measurement of BH spin in these systems. After that, he worked at Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Centre (NCAC) as a postdoc between 2014 and 2017 in Poland. Since October 2017, he started to work in Wuhan University. The research interest of Dr. You currently concentrates on the two aspects in BH X-ray binary: (i) studying the outflow/wind in the high/soft state, by the use of the archived data (e.g., RXTE) and on-going data (e.g., HXMT); (ii) Modelling the fast variability in the time domain, including the characteristic Quasi-Periodic-Oscillation (QPO) and broad band noise.
