<b>Scenario:</b><br /><br />The client has pretty standard ConfigMgr setup to manage there primary and dev systems. The clients communicate to Distribution and Management Points however, the PORT 8530 from the Software update Point (<b>SRVSUP01</b>) can not be opened to clients in the dev vlan.<br /><br />Without getting into the technical architecture of the configured firewall rules a second Software update Point would be required to over come this architectural design. However, the Dev client would not switch over to the new SUP (<b>SRVSUP02)</b>.<br /><br />Upon opening a Browser window from a Dev client it was possible to navigate to the addresses below thus confirming the availability of the new SUP.<br /><br /><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">http://<b style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">SRVSUP02</b><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;; font-size: xx-small;"><b>.Contoso.local</b></span>:8530/SimpleAuthWebService/SimpleAuth.asmx</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/goog_594597816">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: 11pt;">http://</span><b style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">SRVSUP02</b><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;; font-size: xx-small;"><b>.Contoso.local</b></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">:8530/ClientWebService/wusserverversion.xml</span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/goog_594597816">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: 11pt;">http://</span><b style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">SRVSUP02</b><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;; font-size: xx-small;"><b>.Contoso.local</b></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">:8530/Selfupdate/wuident.cab</span></div><br />The WUAHandler.log was reporting a scan failure error code:&nbsp;0x8024401c.
