## Membership

Thank you for your interest in the Y Guides program

Families participating in Y Guides develop strong father-son or father-daughter bonds that support self-esteem and communication skills, setting the foundation for positive, lifelong relationships.

A great way to learn about our program is for you and your child to experience it for yourselves!  Join us for the day at a camp out or any of our other Guides events.


We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the program.  You can pose a question via email or arrange for a discussion with us by reaching out through the Contact Us page.  You can also contact the Waukesha YMCA at (262) 542-2557.

*Note that membership with the Waukesha YMCA is not a requirement for joining the Y-Guides program.
