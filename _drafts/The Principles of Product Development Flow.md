FIFO prioritization is almost never economically optimal in product development, because product development deals with high variability, nonrepetitive, nonhomogeneous flows.

the only way to comprehend the economic importance of queues is to quantify the cost of delay for product development projects.

developers focus on what we call proxy variables. A proxy variable is a quantified measure that substitutes for the real economic objective: life-cycle profits. 

inventory is financially invisible in product development.

product development inventory because it is usually physically invisible.

the misguided pursuit of efficiency creates enormous costs in the unmeasured, invisible portion of the product development process, its queues.

without variability, we cannot innovate.

We cannot eliminate all variability without eliminating all value-added.
