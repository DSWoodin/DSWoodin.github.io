This mindset has helped me a lot when it comes to making improvements these last few years. The first and most important part of this mindset is that almost everything can be trained and improved. At its core, it's similar to the growth mindset, but I find there are some other distinct benefits to using the muscle analogy.

I think you can roughly separate areas to get better into three different buckets.

-   **Learned skills,** Acquiring new knowledge or polishing techniques. (**Examples:** Learning an instrument, programming.)
    
-   **Confidence skills,** Expanding your comfort zone. (**Examples:** Anything social public speaking, sales.)
    
-   **Internal Skills**: How you act and react. (**Examples**: discipline, dealing with negative emotions, ability to focus.)
    

There is a lot of overlap in improving in these areas to how your muscles grow. When it comes to physical improvement most of these things are widely accepted because it is easy to measure. But I think we tend to gloss over many of the same concepts when it comes to other areas.

Resistance

Resistance is the cornerstone both of muscle-growth, and this analogy.

-   When **learning**, feeling some level of stress is not a bad thing. You are trying to cement new connections in your brain, which **should** come with some difficulty. If learning is always easy for you, you are not learning very efficiently. Whenever I am trying to learn something and start to feel frustrated, I tell myself that it is in these periods I am actually making progress.
    
-   You improve your **confidence** by expanding your comfort zone, and you expand your comfort zone by doing things that make you feel uncomfortable until you get used to it. The more uncomfortable you are about doing something, the more you stand to benefit from doing it.
    
-   Improving **Internal** skills only happens when you are faced with some difficulty. You don't become a more resilient person on days where there is nothing that needs resilience.
    

The main point is that you can reframe a negative feeling or experience into a positive opportunity for growth. If I am trying to improve how I deal with setbacks and something bad happens. Either I can embrace feeling bad and get nothing out of it. Or, I can reframe the situation as an opportunity to grow, and the better I handle the situation, the more I grow. The same is true about things like sticking to habits. Not only am I getting the benefit of the habit itself, but I am also strengthening my discipline.

Atrophy

Being aware of this is particularly relevant when it comes to internal skills, as they do not only atrophy by not being used. You will often have the option to either progress by making the right choice, or regress, by making the wrong choice.

If I am trying to diet and get tempted to cheat, I don't only think about sticking to my diet for the nutritional benefits. I also realize that if I give in to temptation and cheat on my diet, it will become easier to make the same decision in the future.

Injury

Just looking at Resistance and Atrophy, it could seem like you should always lean into resistance and never compromise. But if you do that, you are going to face 'injury'. You are going to quit or burn out. The main similarity here is that it is usually caused by ignoring signs that you need to rest and pushing onwards for relatively small gains. The gains you get in the moment will generally be minimal, if at all, but will eventually lead to major setbacks.

Consistency

Closely related to the point above about injury. More than anything, what you need is consistency. It doesn't matter if you are improving in the most efficient way or putting in the maximum number of hours per day. If you manage to stay consistent, you will eventually get where you want. On the other hand, if you do quit, you will never get anywhere regardless of how well you did for a short period. Focus on building the habit first and worry about optimization later.

Plateaus

When improving, your progress is not going to be linear. It can also be difficult to appreciate how much you have improved when you are in the thick of it.

There is a [**Graph**](https://onanimation.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/graph.jpg?w=640) I found, it's about learning art, but I think it applies to many areas. Not only does your skill hit plateaus to be overcome. Your skill at evaluating progress is on a different track than your skill at creating. So when you are at a plateau where your skill is not progressing as quickly, your ability to see your own mistakes will be progressing, and it can even feel like you are going backward.

Difficulty

Things get easier. This can be very hard to fully appreciate when you are starting out, but it is so true and so important. If you are not used to working out, starting is going to be incredibly difficult. It will require a lot of energy to take the first step. It's going to feel like shit during, afterward, you will be exhausted, and the day after, your entire body hurts.

The same is true for trying to improve in new areas. If you are not used to it, there will be many hurdles to overcome, and you will see a lot of failures. But the truth for both of these is that the more you do it, the easier and more rewarding it becomes, and something you used to dread can eventually become something fulfilling that you look forward to.

Rest

It's obvious that you can't just work out 16 hours a day and become ripped in a few weeks. But I think it's underappreciated how much this applies to everything else. People get stuck in this idea that the only way to do learn is to throw more time at it.

In reality, the way you improve more is to increase your rate of learning, and to do this, getting enough rest is probably the most important component. Don't worry about how much time you are able to put in. Worry about how what you get out of that time.

Health

Everyone knows that nutrition, sleep (and exercise), impacts muscle growth. Most people also appreciate how neglecting those areas affects your behavior. If you sleep less, you will be more tired and be able to do less.

But I think one aspect many people ignore is that neglecting your health will lead to worse results for the same amount of effort. When you are trying to learn or improve, you are trying to cement memories and form different connections in your brain, and if your body is not getting enough sleep or nutrition, you are just going to be worse at doing that. So not only will it be more challenging to put in the same amount of effort, even if you manage to put in the same amount of effort, you will get worse results for it.

I made this post in preparation for making a video about it:[T**he Key to Improving Yourself: Everything is a Muscle.**](https://youtu.be/K8nfJyeoP20) I have come to realize that its much easier for me to write a post about something than it is to write a script. I still had to rewrite this post three times before I was able to get it down to a digestible length though, anyway, hopefully this was useful to some of you : \]
