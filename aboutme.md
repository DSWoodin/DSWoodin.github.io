My name is Jay Brophy. Hard to believe you can really learn much about the "true" me from a website (especially one that I have created!). For purposes of this site:

- I am a contrarian cardiologist
- I am a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Epidmeiology & Biostatistics at McGill

What else do you need?

### my history

Why would you really care?
