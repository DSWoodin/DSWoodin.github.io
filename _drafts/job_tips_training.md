 If this is a career position, here is my advice

1) Learn as much as you can.  If they offer paying for education, take advantage of it.
2) Learn a variety of skills.  Be useful across a wide range of tasks.  Don't get pigeon-holded.
3) My rule of thumb is that the first six months at a job are training.  The next six months, you should be competent at the position.  After a year, you should be able to train new hires.  This also gives you experience at people management skills.
4) When you train someone, let them watch you do it while you explain.  The next time, watch them do it and help when needed.  Be patient with their questions.  The third time and on, they should be able to do it with less and less help.  Don't be afraid to let them know this.  Tell them to write stuff down if they can't remember. (But never passwords)
5) It looks bad on a resume if you have a history of short term jobs that you left of your own accord.  You should plan to work a job at a minimum of two years.
6) This is a generalization, but a company wants to get the work done as cheaply as possible which is in opposition to your wanting to be paid as much as possible.  This is especially true the larger and more bureaucratic a company.  In these cases, your greatest opportunity for advancement and/or pay increase might mean looking for these opportunities at another company.
7) Get noticed.  If a project is available that is high visibility and looks interesting, attempt to get put on it.  Work hard to make it succeed.  If it is successful, a lot of face time with higher-ups will help get you on the fast track.
8) Look for a mentor who is successful in the company.  Moving up the ladder, means more perks and pay.
9) Don't talk crap about people.  You never know who they know or when it might come back to bite you.  A positive attitude will serve you better than a negative one.  10) If you want to advance in a company, look to be ready to perform at the next level.  Look to help to do the kind of work of the person above you.  Then you will be ready to go when the opportunity becomes available.
