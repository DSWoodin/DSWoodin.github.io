I've been looking after animals for years, mostly for half-a-dozen long-term customers. I also do domestic cleaning.

Recently I've mostly looked after dogs but in the past I've cared for several generations of customers' cats.

My husband Bill always helps me Caring for your dog at home allows me and Bill to forming a relationship with your dog


 - Pet Sitting costs Â£30 per day or part of day:
 - We sleep overnight in your house using our own bedding
 - At least one of us stays with your pet for most of the day
 - Dogs get walked twice a day
 - We bring our own food
 - We leave your house in the same state we found it

I only look after pets in their own homes. I can't take them into my home and I can't take on regular dog walking.

Because I can only sit one house at a time and am sometimes continuously booked, please contact me well in advance.
