desp: Cliff Meyer received his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton University in 2003. He is a computational biologist with expertise in algorithm development, genomic data integration, cancer gene regulation, epigenetics and nuclear receptor biology. His work includes methodological research projects, collaborative research with experimental biologists, and the broad dissemination of research findings through review articles and software. He has contributed to the development of several widely used algorithms for ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, DNA methylation and CRISPR screen data analysis. Through integrating genome-wide transcription factor binding, chromatin dynamics, and gene expression profiles, he has studied the specificity and function of transcription factors, and chromatin regulators, and has experience in large-scale genomic data integration.
