 Exactly one year ago I took up reading, today I finished my 250th book. These have been my favorites. 

Science Fiction:

The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good "alien" or "first contact" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future.

Dune, Frank Herbert -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer.

Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

Fiction:

The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel "Secret History", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to "start fresh" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over.

The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start.

Non-Fiction:

Missoula, Jon Krakauer -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one.

Tribe, Sebastian Junger -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary "Restrepo" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so.

No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me.

The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

Science:

A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna -- If you've heard of the gene editing method "CRISPR" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read.

The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it.

Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it.

History:

The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union.

House To House, SSG. David Bellavia -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think "bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read.

Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book.

Books that live up to the hype:

Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance.

A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday.

Anything by Kurt Vonnegut -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

Dark Matter, Blake Crouch -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book "Recursion" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

Overall favorite book:

East of Eden, John Steinbeck -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading.
