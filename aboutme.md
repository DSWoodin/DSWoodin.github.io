Hi, my name is Kelly and Iâ€™m a simple home management coach. I homeschool our four children (ages 11-3) on the east coast of Canada as well as work part-time in social media. I left my teaching job over nine years ago to stay home and it was after that that I realized I needed to get better - much better - at managing the home.

**Picture this:** I was pregnant with our third and I remember standing in the kitchen with a ginormous to do list on scrap piece paper. Suddenly, I broke into tears. I felt completely alone and overwhelmed. I felt inadequate and didnâ€™t know where to even start with my list. That was a big turning point for me.

From there, I learned about simple planning, read about minimalism, and decluttered our whole home. I also started to create routines, starting with laundry! I had no one to show me the way forward but friends in books and Iâ€™m here at Simple Home Mom to be there for YOU if you are that mom right now. I want to be with you and help guide you to better home management. Weâ€™ve got this! â€¦ together! It brings me great joy that my years of studying and applying home management skills are being passed onto other overwhelmed stay at home moms.

I recently hit 10K followers on [Instagram](www.instagram.com/simplehomemom) after quite a few years of sharing my work! Thatâ€™s where you can find me hanging out the most. See you there!

Listen more about my take on simplifying things at home on a podcast I was interviewed on [here](https://www.stitcher.com/show/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/episode/keeping-it-simple-an-interview-with-kelly-79787253).
