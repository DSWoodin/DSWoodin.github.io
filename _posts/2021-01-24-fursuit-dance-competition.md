We're now accepting submissions for our Fursuit Dance Competition. Since we're virtual this year, the Fursuit Dance Competition is going to run a little differently. We're asking our dancers to record themselves dancing and send those videos in before the convention (Submissions should be between 1:30 and 2:15 minutes long and show off your dancing skills\!). During the competition we'll be playing those videos and our trio of judges will go over each performance.

To submit your recording, you can upload the video to Youtube (as an unlisted video), Dropbox, or Google Drive. Email the link to programming@fursquared.com with your furry name and 'Fursuit Dance Comp Submission' in the subject line.

Remember to have fun and shake those tails\!
