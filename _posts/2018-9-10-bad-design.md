For my example of bad design, I have chosen the page for viewing and editing one's meal plan from the Williams College PeopleSoft site. This page is likely only accessible by students, although it can be found by logging into https://sarah.williams.edu and navigating to the main menu, then clicking "Self Service" followed by "Campus Life", "Dining Services", and finally, "My Board Plan". Below is an image of the My Board Plan page.
