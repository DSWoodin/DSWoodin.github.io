How much time do you gain if 25% of meetings vanished? Many do more.

Imagine uninterrupted periods to yourself or more time with family? Now, let's help reduce counterproductive meetings by leveraging technology modern methodology to win time to do what we want.

I want to cash in our rain check :)  After really analyzing my interests and skills over the past few months, I've come to the conclusion that the best next step for my career is to move into SalesOps.

I would love to connect with you sooner rather to get your insights on the SalesOps function in general and possibly identify opportunities around the city. I know I could learn so much from you, and I would really value your advice and knowledge here.

Hey FRIEND,

Happy (rainy) hump day and hope all is well!

I want to cash in our rain check :)  I've come to the conclusion that the best next step for my career is to move into SalesOps and know I could learn so much from you.

Am eager to connect sooner rather than later because I need to restructure my approach for my job search and believe you could help me prioritize a plan and identify potential areas of opportunity.

Obviously, I'd love to meet in person and catch up, but am happy to chat over the phone if it's easier.

Look forward to hearing from you soon and feel free to call/text my cell or email me anytime to coordinate.

Best,
Tudor

I've concluded that the best next step for my career is to move into SalesOps (ideally manager reporting to a senior director who can groom me).

Do you have any recommendations for restructuring my approach to better appeal to this role?
