# Programming Tracks at Fur Squared

We've been hard at work testing (and breaking, and fixing, and...) the platform we'll be using for Virtual Fur Squared 2021. Now that we better understand the platform we'll be using, we can finally announce details about what Programming will look like for Fur Squared 2021\!

At a high level, Fur Squared will be streaming two separate programming tracks: A **Main Events** stream full of the hilarity and madness you've come to expect from us, and a brand new **Artists & Dealers Track**\! Additionally, we will maintain a schedule of **Secondary Events** hosted by members of the fandom, for a total of three programming tracks.

## Main Events Track

As mentioned, this track will be full of the usual hilarity and madness you've come to expect from our convention. This is our primary paneling track, and will consist of scheduled panels both live and pre-recorded. The typical panel time slot will be 50 minutes to accommodate all the necessary back-end finagling we need to do between panels. During the 10 minute interval between panels, we will be running entertaining interstitials, informational bumps, and **community-submitted commercials** to help highlight creators in the fandom that may be struggling right now (*submissions opening soon*).

### Are panel submissions still open?

Yes\! [Click here to learn more about Virtual Fur Squared Programming](/programming). Please note: We plan to close submissions at **the end of November** (*a month earlier than normal\!)&nbsp;*to allow proper lead time for both us and our panelists.

## Artists & Dealers Track

We've been brainstorming ways to help continue to support our fandom's artists and dealers in the context of a virtual event. If you've seen our Twitter lately, you might already have an idea of what's going to happen.

This stream will feature several artist and dealer streams on screen at the same time. These streams will be automatically selected from a list of streamers that have applied, and will rotate through the list at regular intervals. Our goal is to help simulate a Dealer's Den and Artist's Alley experience.

Because we will be streaming video from several people at once, audio from these streams will not be included. Instead, we hope to play original music produced by musicians in the fandom - both as a mix, and in scheduled musical blocks.

**Interested in applying to be an artist, dealer, or musician**? Watch this website and our Twitter for further announcements\!

Please note that we will be performing an internal tech test of this proposed system soon, and details are still volatile and subject to change. We will have more information for you Soon\!

## Secondary Events Track

At our in-person convention, we have over 100 hours of programming spread across some dozen panel rooms. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the means to provide such extensive programming while also running a virtual event for the first time. As a compromise, we have created the *Secondary Events Track*. If you submit a panel that is accepted as a secondary event, we will have it listed on the official schedule and will advertise for it, but we will not directly host it ourselves. Instead, we will point attendees to your event, be it on YouTube, Twitch, Picarto, or elsewhere.

We will have more details on how this will work Soon. In the meantime, if you have a programming idea, please see the link above to submit it before the end of November\!
