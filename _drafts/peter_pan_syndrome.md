 From Wikipedia: “Dr. Dan Kiley popularised the Peter Pan syndrome in his 1983 book, The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up, about individuals (usually male) with underdeveloped maturity; his next book, The Wendy Dilemma (1984), advises women romantically involved with "Peter Pans" how to improve their relationships.”

Reading this book actually made it much easier for me to end this relationship with very little heartbreak for myself.  I paid more attention to how his mother treated him (like he was an incapable infant who needed someone else to make decisions for him) and realized he was basically using me as a mother when she was not around.  I gradually lost literally all sexual attraction to him and then all respect for him and it was very easy to separate myself from him with little emotional pain.  Most of my breakup pain was frustration with myself for staying around so long.  He needed a mother so badly that he was actually not even capable of packing his own shit to get out of my house- this was the last instance of mothering I was happy to do!
