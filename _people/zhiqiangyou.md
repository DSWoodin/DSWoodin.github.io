# Bio

Zhiqiang You, Ph.D. student at Wuhan University, working on cosmology and gravitational wave data analyze. As LIGO detects the first gravitational wave (GW) and the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of the first binary neutron star is confirmed by other band detection, GW astronomy provides a unique new way to study the cosmology and precisely measure the Hubble constant. At present, the mainly applied investigation is that combines the luminosity distance inferred by the GW standard sirens with the redshift detected by the EM counterpart to estimate the cosmological parameters. While the detection of EM counterpart is more difficult, features in the stellar-mass black hole population break the mass-redshift degeneracy and facilitate precise determination of the Hubble parameter without EM counterparts or host galaxy catalogs. Using the hierarchical Bayesian inference model, the Hubble constant will be well constrained.
