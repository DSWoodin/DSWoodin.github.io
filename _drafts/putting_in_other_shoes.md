 I want to point out that "understanding what you've never experienced" is what women are forced to do, socialised into doing, since birth. 

When your legislation, education, entertainment and media are all channeling the voices of (straight white) men assumed to be the default, women are conditioned to be empathetic of male voices and experiences. 

The reason why some men find it difficult to understand something they've never experienced is largely because they've never been challenged to (or bothered to) identify a narrative other than their own. That **is** the patriarchy.
