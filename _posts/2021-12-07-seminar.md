## Abstract

Black hole accretion flows are accompanied by outflows, including wind and jet. In the first part of my talk, I will talk about wind launched from hot accretion flows, including: 1) why we think wind must exist; 2) the main physical properties such as mass flux and velocity; 3) acceleration mechanism; 4) comparison between jet and wind; and 5) observational evidences. In the second part of my talk, I will focus on the episodic jet and its associated flares. Such kind of phenomena are widely observed in black hole sources such as Sgr A* and M87. In some cases, the ejection speed is measured and some periodicity is found. I will introduce our MHD model for the ejection and flares, which is based on our three dimensional MHD numerical simulations.
