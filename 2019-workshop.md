title: 2019 Synthesis Workshop
and working groups
---

This workshop will focus on what is unique about the ocean environment as a stage for evolution and adaptation to play out. 
We will prioritize lines of inquiry that will advance knowledge in both marine science and evolutionary biology. 
In addition, we aim to reach concensus on the appropriate experimental designs and analyses for studying adaptation in marine species,
given the logistical contraints of working in marine systems.

This workshop will be held at Shoals Marine Lab in summer 2019.
