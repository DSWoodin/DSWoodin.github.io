 I feel qualified to answer this question. I've been working with blockchain for two years whether making architectural decisions, using API or coding hands-on. 

I've worked with Ethereum, a permissionless blockchain. And I am currently working with Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned distributed ledger.

Ethereum is written in Solidity and it's easy to learn. There's an awesome game called [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) that teaches beginners how to code smart contracts in Solidity. The most popular contracts are ERC-20 and ERC-721. Tools to learn Ethereum were not always user friendly but it has come a long way in the past two years. There are test networks and online tools to deploy smart contracts easily. 

For a higher level understanding, I had a hard time finding good up-to-date comparison charts of all the different flavors of blockchain. Even though it is outdated, this is the best I have found just to get a gist of the different consensus mechanism and the blockchains that use them. https://tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/
Love this  [infographic](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LLG7gr0ydPNrSJQ43vf%2F-L_iZxa6g34SxFiavXti%2F-L_i_KAsL6qzKH4BNQe5%2FBlockchainConsensusEncyclopedia-by-tokens-economy.com.png?alt=media&token=f84fbfe7-4a94-43b3-b0b9-168bf951c78f)

For a deeper understanding, it's recommended to go straight to reading academic white papers. The Bitcoin whitepaper is quite short.

Udemy and Coursera, in my experience, were outdated when I was learning Fabric but they might be good for Ethereum.

The best part of this space is the community. The Ethereum core team is quite small (on and off, maybe 20 developers) and some are very active on Twitter. The energy is very passionate with a hint of anarchy. The best technical events are run by EthGlobal and DevCon. I don't recommend "crypto" oriented conferences like World Crypto Con. They tend to be too high level and salesy. A fun but non-technical event is The Futurist Conference in Toronto. If you can afford it, the international events held by DevCon are the most legit. The newest Ethereum tech is announced here. People are super smart. 

There's a couple active groups called Crypto Chicks and Women Who Code: Blockchain. Feel free to reach out, I'm ecstatic to see other blockchain ladies.  You can do it!
