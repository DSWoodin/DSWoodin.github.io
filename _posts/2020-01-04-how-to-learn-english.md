3 months ago, I started a new job. I need to improve my English (especially speaking) because the new company consists of colleagues speaking English.

Unlike before, There are a lot of contents to help learn English.  I know there is no best way to learn english, but I thought there would be a way to learn English that suits me. So I tried various ways to learn English such as shadowing script, listening to English article and watching Disney with English subtitles.

All of the ways have their advantages. But I didn't feel improving my English while I was trying.  I thought that I need to determine which skill is my main priority. I have to explain something to my colleagues in the office, so I should focus on improving speaking than other skills. As a result of I've figured out, I found a way to suit me. It's not a special thing. Here it is. Memorize words and catch the Nuance of it as reading various sentences containing those words. And then make my own sentence multiple times. From my perspective, It a more effective way than just memorizing.
