The optimization of machine learning algorithms is one of the most important research. 
Here we present a breif introduction of **Bayesian Optimization** (BO), a novel search algorithm that can minimize black-box functions.

# Introduction
In a previous post we introduced [Gaussian Processes](intro_GP.md)
