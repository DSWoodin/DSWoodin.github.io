# Bio

Jiang Xiaoming, a 2019 master student in Wuhan University, who has research interest in gravitational wave data analysis and galaxy evolution. Under the guidance of the supervisor, I have finished some projects on galaxy evolution during the undergraduate period. The trigger of the AGN has been a mystery for a long time, one view is that the merger of galaxies is the main mechanism, so we can constrain it from the host galaxy morphology with observation. We have developed a program for visual morphology classification. In addition, we built up the known largest sample of X-ray selected AGN host galaxies via combining X-ray sky surveys and HST’s CANDELS. After completing the visual morphology classification, we obtained some interesting results.
