title: Review English in January
tags: [English]
---
I made plans to check How My English is improving at every 15th of the each month. This is the first review. From last year, I've been using [Ringle](https://www.ringleplus.com/) for getting Tutoring. That service is quite helpful. After every lesson finished, Tutor give me a feedback with score. I think these score is meaningful because It's from native speaker. I keep this data.
I will check How My score is changed and their feed back. This would be helpful what is my flawback of my Enlgish.

I also check How to learn english for now.
Last year, I had plan for everyday for a week. For instance, Monday is for watch the Youtube, Tuesday is for reading article. I've changed this schedule because I need to focus explain my issues to my colleagues. Every night I'm preparing what issue I'm working on and making sentences to deliver to my colleagues. Previously I prepare it in short sentences, but now I try to explain as details as I can. Usually It takes much time. After finished it, I watch the Youtube or read a book.

I will keep doing this until It has not problem.
