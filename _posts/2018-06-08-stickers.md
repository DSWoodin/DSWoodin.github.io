## So, funny story...

I watched a one of the great  video where Damian Brady [@damovisa](https://twitter.com/damovisa)  [Dived into DevOps](https://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/Damovisa#usersessions) where I noticed the cool stickers he had designed. 

Damian lists some of the issues that could go wrong if you publish from a developer machine:
> * Maybe you have something installed on your machine that's not in production. 
> * Maybe you didn't merge all the changes people made. 
> * We loved with a love that was more than love
> * Maybe you did, but you resolved that tricky bit slightly wrong. 
> * Maybe you merged successfully, but forgot to run tests. 
> * Maybe you did run the tests, and they work fine on your machine, but not in production. 
> * Maybe there are untested bugs that don't show up until the app is on a server. 
> * Maybe your OS just got an upgrade and the code no longer compiles.

I asked Damian if I could print some so he kindly shared the template to me on Sticker Mule... I ordered some stickers from Sticker Mule.

After a little time the stickers arrived in Australia from the US and I added it with pride of place on my Surface

I gave also shared some with my government clients and even someone from the VSTS team.

Thanks Damian Brady!
