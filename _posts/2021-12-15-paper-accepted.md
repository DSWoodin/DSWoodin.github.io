Continuous-time hidden Markov models enable researchers to study the relations between risk factors and outcomes
repeatedly measured at unbalanced, unequally spaced assessment times while accommodating measurement
error. Despite extensive implementation of variable selection methods designed to identify potential
relations in exploratory settings for hypothesis generation, currently none have been applied to this class of
models commonly found in psychological research. To fill this gap, we develop a Bayesian continuous-time
hidden Markov model with variable selection priors and provide a flexible R package to facilitate the application
of our method in practice. We showcase the variable selection performance and estimation accuracy of
our method on simulated data and apply it to intensive longitudinal data collected in a smoking cessation trial
to identify potential risk factors associated with smoking behaviors after a quit attempt.
