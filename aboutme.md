Hi, Iâ€™m Kelly! Iâ€™m a mother of four children - three boys, one toddler girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. Iâ€™m a past elementary teacher, turned stay at home, work at home mom eight years ago after I had my second child. Iâ€™ve found that the busier Iâ€™ve become and as my children age, that itâ€™s become even more important to figure out what is most important to me and us as a family. Living a simpler lifestyle has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, and stronger connections with my people. It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of my home and life. I enjoy helping busy moms simplify home life by teaching flexible planning methods and skills. Listen more about my take on simplifying things at home on a podcast I was interviewed on [here](https://www.stitcher.com/show/make-joy-normal-cozy-homeschooling/episode/keeping-it-simple-an-interview-with-kelly-79787253). And a blog of mine you may like: [Four Ways to Create a Simpler Home](https://www.simplehomemom.com/four-ways-to-create-a-simpler-home/).
