 It's evidence that this messaging works exactly as intended. True equality will never be more profitable than the current system which relies on a certain degree of exploitation, whether that be of borderline slave labor in poorer countries, or of black culture in areas like music on home soil. 

The economical incentive of companies is diametrically opposed to true equality, which makes this fake 'we care' schtick the best possible move for them because it tricks the people you're talking about into thinking that real change is coming. It calms down the protests so that everything can resume working the same way it always has.
