 If you work hard and are loyal to your company, they will be loyal to you. 

The sad reality is most large companies don't care anymore and will lay you off after being there for 10+ years even if you were a devoted and hard working employee.

Always have a 6 months pay in the bank and always be networking to have your next job lined up.
