Analyzing multivariate count data generated by high-throughput sequencing technology in microbiome
research studies is challenging due to the high-dimensional and compositional structure of the data 
and overdispersion.  In practice, researchers are often interested in investigating how the microbiome 
may mediate the relation between an assigned treatment and an observed phenotypic response. 
Existing approaches designed for compositional mediation analysis are unable to simultaneously determine 
the presence of direct effects, relative indirect effects, and overall indirect effects, while
quantifying their uncertainty. We propose a formulation of a Bayesian joint model for compositional data 
that allows for the identification, estimation, and uncertainty quantification of various causal estimands 
in high-dimensional mediation analysis. We conduct simulation studies and compare our method's mediation
effects selection performance with existing methods.  Finally, we apply our method to a benchmark data set
investigating the sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment effect on body weight in early-life mice.
