As far as What I wrote multiple times this blog, Currently I focus on speaking English. To Archive it. I should set What is my ultimate goal and What is I want to be in my mind.
First, It's about my ultimate goal. When I was in south Korea, My goal was watching hollywood movie without subtitle. I wanted to focus on watching actor's behavior. Watching movie with subtitle make us miss good play of them.
Now My goal is changed. I want to speak my thought fluently. Basically Speaking is delivering my idea to the listener. This is not only for English but also Korean. Someone's speaking is clear means She or he select proper words and speak with good intonation and organized sentence structure.

To be like that I need more vocabulary and practice intonation as well. For now I'm learning not only English but also Speaking from native speaker.

During that process, I need to find legimate words and making setence sturcture. It have to happen very fast in my head.
