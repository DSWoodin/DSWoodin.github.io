# Bio

Tais Maiolino, research fellow at Wuhan University, working on spectral and timing analysis of X-ray binaries observed with the Insight-HXMT — the China’s first X-ray astronomy satellite. My main research interest focus on the description of the broadband spectral continuum, spectral features and proprieties of Galactic accretion-powered X-ray compact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs). Using also data from other observatories (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL and Chandra) I have been studying low mass X-ray binaries(including low mass X-ray dippers), high mass X-ray binaries, and cataclysms variables.
