 A plea to the fathers, brothers, significant others: please don’t respond to this realization by asking the women in your lives to change their behavior, clothing, etc. Far too many men still do that. As girls, we grew up with this ogling, we’ve learned how to tune it out and carry on with our lives. It just makes matters worse when well intentioned men in our lives want us to change. That doesn’t solve my problem, it’s only an attempt to solve theirs.
