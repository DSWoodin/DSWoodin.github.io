 It was like that for me when I was ok with the casual misogyny and forgave them for passively racist remarks. But once I started calling that shit out after finally coming out as queer, I lost the majority of my guy friends. It's sad AF but I do feel better not forcing myself to deal with that environment. I've been seeking out healthier relationships with more femme and queer folk, since there's a general understanding of respect that's much easier to cultivate in our shared experiences. I'm mostly a hermit now, though, so pretty much have no friends.
