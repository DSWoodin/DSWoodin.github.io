 In the workplace, dont take on responsibility if you're not being properly compensated for it. Too many people are overworked and overstressed because they agree to take on extra tasks that are outside their job description. Work is a part of life, treat it as such and no more.

On a related note, in all parts of life learn to say "No" and be comfortable with saying "No". A moment of politeness is not worth a period of misery.
