Exploring philosophy is not like mathematics. You should start with ideas that are more familiar to you, and follow links in bibliography/and footnotes to reach previous philosophers on which Derrida and Deleuze, or Zizek built their ideas.
Always get the book with the most footnotes, and follow them if the idea fascinates you and is relevant to your current state of knowledge.
Don't try to "understand everything" at once. Focus on the bits that speak to you personally, and after years you will get the entirety anyway.
Make it a pleasant like eating cakes, amuse yourself. All those scholars who read thousands of books have often no idea what are they talking about.
Avoid creating a "quoting brain" - follow only thoughts which you understand, which you have the feeling for. Quoting an idea does not mean you understand it - understanding comes from ability to use this idea in different contexts, so you must understand it deeply first, as if make it your own. 

Be like a thief. Go to a philosopher and steal his ideas. Live the life of a textual burglar. You build your own individuality from stolen bits. Don't ever hesitate.
