Wow, yes. Especially if I’m in an argument I want to leave immediately so I can process what I’m actually feeling. If I’m pushed past this or can’t leave then I blow up because I couldn’t process it at my pace.

Definitely feel my most intensely with music, I used to do these looong drives (12-20 hours straight) when I bounced around the country for my job and it would be me alone with the music of my choice and it was magical to feel things that intensely and openly. Nothing else compares.
