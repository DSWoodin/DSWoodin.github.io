 I've got complicated emotions. When I first read Wizards First Rule when it came out, I was a teenager tired of being forced to read things like The Great Gatsby and Great Expectations. It was so edgy at the time for a mainstream fantasy book. BDSM Sex? Threatening to kill a snotty child? Sign me up!

As the books got more... philosophical, I started losing more and more interest. As I read interview after interview where Terry Goodkind came across as... not so great, I lost even more. Of course, I'll never really know if it was due to all that or simply growing up and losing my teenage edgelord status.Towards the end of my interest, I rushed to the book store after a business trip to stand in line to get some books signed by him. I'm not really sure why; maybe just out of pure nostalgia.

He was genuinely happy to be signing books and being around fans. His wife was also there, and she was smiling and happy. She looked so proud of him. He inscribed and signed two books for me, one of the ones I brought in (Faith of the Fallen) and Naked Empire, which had just come out and I had purchased at the store.

I too joined in on the wagon of poking fun of him here in this sub a few times, and yet... at the end of the day, he had an influence on me. And while I stopped reading him some time ago, his books will always have a place on my bookshelf.

In writing this out, I can honestly say my emotion is no longer complicated. I'm sad.

Remember the human.
