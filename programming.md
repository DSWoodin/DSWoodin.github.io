###### So what's different this year?

###### What's a pre-recorded panel?

A pre-recorded panel is a panel that will be filmed and edited prior to the convention, and then aired in its entirety. The final version of your pre-recorded panel will need to be submitted no later than Friday, January 15, but once your panel is approved you can submit any version you're happy with and our programming staff will be able to offer feedback or suggestions.

###### How much editing will Fur Squared do for me?

Unfortunately, Fur Squared doesn't have the resources to do any editing on prerecorded panels more involved than minor runtime adjustments.

###### Why do panels have weird times this year?

This year we're asking panelists to end their panels 10 minutes earlier than normal. This will allow us to have theming, charity, or other miscellaneous content between panels, as well as provide a cushion in case we experience technical difficulties.

###### When will I hear back about my submission?

We'll start reviewing panel submissions by mid-August. Once we review your submission, you'll receive an email letting you know if your submission was approved or denied.
