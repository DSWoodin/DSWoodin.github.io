Like with anything, there are many perspectives for finances. What's been working really well for us the past couple years is when we stick to a _zero spend budget_. Today on the blog, I'm sharing about how to do a zero spend month that works for you.

What does a zero spend month look like?

We keep a zero spend month simple - I see it more of a mindset than a list of rules. Essentially, we don't spend unless necessary, simplify, and streamline it all. We've ended up saving a lot of money faster this way too. Which is the goal, right? Little purchases used to add up so quickly for us, so this shift has been huge for us.

### What does a zero spend month look like practically speaking?

Instead of setting aside certain amounts for spending areas such as with a [traditional budget](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/traditional-budgeting-vs-zero-based-budgeting/) (which in the past I'd want to spend if we didn't dip into it), we just track every purchase and take a look at it throughout the month and at the end of the month going forward. We'd then talk about it. Did we really need xyz? And to make new "rules" going forward. Essentially - [mindful budgeting and spending](https://www.moneyunder30.com/mindfulness-can-help-you-save-money#:\~:text=Being%20mindful%20with%20your%20money,if%20it%20matches%20your%20priorities.).

#### Five tips for doing a zero spend month

(that have been helpful for us)

1. Hold off on anything that is not immediate. Giving time to think about if you really need something.
2. Buy second hand where possible.
3. Trade if we can!
4. Avoid "window shopping."
5. Cut back on extras (like that extra coffee when you could bring your awesome one from home, for instance).

#### Some zero spend month benefits (that we’ve found)

Doing a zero spend month that works for you, helps you to become better at [intentional spending](https://circlein.com/tips-to-start-intentionally-saving-and-intentionally-spending/) because you’re reflecting on it so often. We also became much better at intentional saving too. We probably cut the time in half for saving for a basement reno last year by using a zero spend month, for instance.

Make your own rules, guidelines, and be mindful of your spending. Learn from your mistakes and keep going. It’s worth it if you are really looking to be better at your finances.
