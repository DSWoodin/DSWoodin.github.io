<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-user about-icon"></span>
I'm a series of spacetime events called Ricardo (or Richard). I was born in Florida to Cuban and Argentine parents (espa√±ol es mi lengua materna). I'm a high tech low-life, an outdoorsy great indoorsman; voice-activated, user-friendly, self-cleaning, and compostable. I'm a non-believer and an overachiever, laid-back but forward-thinking, a supercharged subversive, a hands-on footloose. I'm a relentless nerd and SJW.

## Travel

- I am currently converting a jumbo news crew van into a tiny home. It has roof-top solar, a fridge/freezer, and fits everything I own!
- I have been to 26 countries so far :) I've done 3 major bicycle tours (from Seattle to San Francisco, around Taiwan, and around New Zealand).
- I've hitchhiked over 10,000 miles in the US, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand.

## Volunteering, Activism, Organizing

- I helped organize a Surveilence Self-Defense Workshop for Activists with TA3M Seattle.
- I organized and led a protest against Congress's plans to end the Internet's decentralized nature. Downtown Seattle, December 2014.
- I spent a month and a half volunteering full-time on Mota Lava, Vanuatu. I was helping communities be more resilient by teaching them to make virgin coconut oil and facilitating business deals. I gave various lectures at the local school and helped get paint for the local church.
- I've volunteered on various organic farms and intentional communities, including the [Awaawaroa Bay Eco Village](https://www.facebook.com/awaawaroabay) and [Wilderland Trust](https://www.facebook.com/WilderlandTrust/), and various other WWOOF and HelpX hosts.
- I was a full-time volunteer for a community science project monitorizing how the worlds largest LPG processing center would affect the world's largest Humpack whale calving area near James Price Point, Australia.
- I've been part of the [Couchsurfing](couchsurfing.org) community since 2011 ([profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/rovingrichard)).
- I have been a Wikipedia editor since 2008 ([profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Richard.decal)).

## Talks and Interviews

- Talk for TA3M Seattle: "How  AI can be abused by surveillance states" ([presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfn3T7R-ufjbzfmlVSMgAIyjC6hYhTTC41LMleQNFcQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- Interview with KOMO news in Seattle over the net neutrality debate
- Interview with [Edventure Project](http://edventureproject.com): [Why we pick up hitchhikers](http://edventureproject.com/why-we-pick-up-hitchhikers/)

## Art

- I was Artist in Residence at the [Sir James Wallace Arts Trust](www.wallaceartstrust.org.nz) for a few months in 2015. A selection of my works are in circulation around public spaces in New Zealand.

## Computing

- **Home server** - I am proud of my home server. I built it myself and run the following services: wallabag, nextcloud, bittorrent, ZeroNet, IPFS, and Tor node.
- **[Mobile library](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBox-Mesh)** - I converted a Raspberry Pi into an awesome mobile filesharing mesh network.
- **Personal Assistant** - I also converted a Raspberry Pi into a fully open-source digital assistant, similar to an Amazon Echo.
