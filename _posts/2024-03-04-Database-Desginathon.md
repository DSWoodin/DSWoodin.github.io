## 1. Soccer team

1. Player-Team: Each player belongs to exactly one team.
2. Team-Players: Teams consist of multiple players.
3. Match-Team: Teams participate in matches, with each match involving multiple teams.
4. Match-Players: Matches feature many players, indicating broad participation across events.

```

## 2. The companyDB

1. Company-Employee: A "One-to-Many" relationship, indicating that a company employs many employees, but each employee works for a single company.
2. Company-Project: Another "One-to-Many" relationship, showing that a company can have multiple projects, with each project belonging to one company.
3. Employee-Project (involved in many): This represents a "Many-to-Many" relationship. Employees can be involved in many projects, and projects can have many employees working on them.
4. Project-Employee (has many): While appearing similar to the above, this contextually suggests the allocation of employees to projects, typically reflecting roles or responsibilities within those projects.
5. Employee-Manager: A "One-to-One" relationship, indicating that each employee reports to a single manager. This relationship is unique and exclusive, showing a direct reporting line.
6. Employee-Project (manages): A "One-to-Many" relationship, where an employee (likely in a managerial or leadership role) manages multiple projects, showcasing the responsibility of project oversight.

## 3. Academic Social Network

I made this diagram for having academic social network. First, I made user equity to let users have a account. User can create account including name, email, and address. I can identify user based on the userId as a prime key. Since pages are created when courses are made. I used course_id as a foreign key and then include name and code in the courses entity. Finally, users can made posts in a page and create comments in posts.

1. Users-Friendship Requests: Users can send multiple friendship requests, but each request is from a single user.
2. Courses-Pages: Each course is directly associated with a single, specific page.
3. Users-Posts: Users can create multiple posts, with each post attributed to one user.
4. Users-Courses: Users can subscribe to many courses, indicating a user's enrollment or interest in various educational subjects.
5. Users-Comments: Users can make multiple comments on posts or pages, with each comment made by one user.
6. Posts-Comments: Each post can have multiple comments, indicating engagement and discussion generated by the content.

```

## 4. The Symphony Orchestra concert DB

My assumption

- It has a time period during which a series of concerts of performed (each season has many concerts and a concert belongs to a season)
- In a concert, one or more compositions are performed and a concert should be conducted by one condutor (each concert has one or many compositions)
- A composition can be played at multiple concerts and requires more than one soloist or may not require a soloist
- A conductor can perform multiple concerts
- A soloist can perform only one or more given composition at a particular concert, but is scheduled for only one season.

```
erDiagram

    Season {
        string seasonID PK
        string name
        date startDate
        date endDate
    }

    Concert {
        string concertID PK
        string seasonID FK
        string conductorID FK
        date date

    Composition {
        string compositionID PK
        string concertID FK
        string name
        string composer

    Conductor {
        string conductorID PK
        string name

    Soloist {

## 5. A Cable TV company

- Customer stores details about the customers (userId, name, rented film ID, renting file id, payment Details, account details) can rent flims
- Film contains information about the films available for rent(Id, title, genre, **price**, duration, rental start date, rental end date)
- Rental represents the event of a film being rented by a customer
- Billing represents the monthly billing details for each customer

```

    COMPANY {
    string name

## 6. Justiz: a large law firm (Physical data modeling)

- Each laywer is related to only one firm, but a firm can have multiple laywers.
- An enemy is an opposing party in a lawsuit, and each enemy is represented by exactly one enemy_lawer, while each enemy_lawer can represent multiple enemys.
- A lawsuit can have multiple trials, but each trial is associated with one lawsuit.
- Each court can host many trials, but a trial happens in one court.
- A trial can have multiple witnesses.

```

    LAWSUIT {
        string id PK

## 7. Faster: a mini bus solution

- A driver stores details about the drivers, including their unique employee number, name, hire date, phone numbers, address, and years of experience.
- A emergency contact stores the emergency contact information for each driver, including name, address, and telephone number.
- A bus includes details of each bus, such as the bus ID, manufacturer, manufacturing year, and capacity.
- A route captures information about the bus routes, such as the route ID, starting point, ending point, and a description of the route.
- A trip tracks the trips made by the buses, with details about the departure time, arrival time, and direction of the trip.
