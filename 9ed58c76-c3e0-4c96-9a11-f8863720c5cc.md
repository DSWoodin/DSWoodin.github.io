 THE book that helped me make a painful but life-changing transition (from self-destructive to objectively healthy) 'This is How' by Augusten Burroughs. I may even owe my life to that book.  

I've learned, a little late in life, that when you are truly ready to change and make a real effort - things really do get better. Sounds corny but it is true.
