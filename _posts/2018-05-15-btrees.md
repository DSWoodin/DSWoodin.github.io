I created a small React application to go along with this blog-post.
It allows one to insert nodes into, and visualize the formation of, a B-Tree of order 4. 

A link to a github repository will be up soon!

## On Trees ##
Trees are prominent, non-linear data structures with a wide range of 
use-cases, including: 

* Representing priority queues (as **heaps**) 
* Serving as the foundational structure of decision making algorithms,
i.e. the Decision Tree.
* Providing effecient access to stored information when balanced, as in the case of B-Trees
* Representing the DOM!


Tree data structures can be visualized by imagining a real life tree
hanging upside down, where its root is at the top and the branches and
leaves spread out downwards.

{: refdef}


The individual components of a tree are called **nodes**, and the topmost
component is the **root node**. Nodes with branches are called 
**branch nodes**, and the bottom-most nodes with no connecting branches
are called **leaf nodes**. Every node has data, as well as zero or more
**children**, which are the nodes on a deeper level that are connected to it.

**More properties of trees:**
* A **path** is a sequence of connected nodes.
* A path is of **length** n where n is the number of nodes in the path.
* The **height** of a tree is the length of the longest path from
the root node to a leaf.
* The **depth** of a node is the length of the path from said node to the 
root.


Trees can be structured in specific ways to accomplish different tasks.
For instance, a **Binary Search Tree** (shown below) is a tree such that:
1. The left subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys lesser than 
said node's key.
1. The right subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys greater than
said node's key.
1. Each left and right subtree must also be Binary Search Trees, i.e. the above two conditions hold all throughout the levels of the tree.
1. There can be no duplicate nodes.


{% highlight javascript %}
            [8]        //root, depth = 0. Tree of height 3. key = 8.
           /   \ 
          /     \
         [3]    [10]  //<-- depth = 1. height = 2
        /  \      \
       /    \      \
      [1]   [6]     [14]  //leaf node, depth = 2
{% endhighlight %}


A binary search tree with height n has O(log n) levels if implemented 
correctly. This means searching is an O(log n) operation as compared to
an array, where it is an O(n) operation.

## On B-Trees ##
A **B-Tree** is a self-balancing search tree and extension of the **Binary Search Tree.**
Each node has a maximum of "m" children, which means it is of order "m". 
A Binary Search Tree can also be thought of as a B-tree of order 2.

**A B-tree of order "m":**

* Each node has at MOST "m" children.

* Each internal node has at least $$\ulcorner m/2 \urcorner$$ children.

* Root has at least 2 children if it is not a leaf.

* Non-leaf node with "k" children will have (k-1) keys.
	For a given key, all children to the left will have keys less than that key, and all children to the right will be greater.
	{% highlight javascript %}

               [[5] [9]]      //2 Keys
                /  |  \       
               /   |   \         
              /    |    \     //3 Children
      [[1][2]] [[6][7]]  [[10][11] 
    {% endhighlight %}
* All leaves appear in the same level. Important for maintaining a 
height bound!

The structure of a B-Tree is maintained by the algorithm by which
nodes are inserted to the tree. Any insertion must occur at a leaf node.
The process is outlined as below, and was adapted from "Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen. It's a pro-active insertion algorithm:


1. Start with currentNode as the root.
2. While currentNode is not a leaf, 

	* Find child x to be traversed to.
	* If child x is not full, change currentNode to child x.
	* If child x is full, **split()** the node into partA and partB.
	  	* If they inserted key is < the mid value of currentNode, set 
	  	  currentNode to the firt part, partA, else partB. 
	  	* When splitting the currentNode, we move a key from currentNode 
	  	  to its parent
3. Exit loop in step 2 when x is a leaf. At this point, x must have room
   for the key due to all the splitting we've done in advance.


There are numerous other trees worth checking out! These include: 
* **Red-Black Trees**, a self-balancing binary search tree where each 
  node also has a bit that is interpreted as the color of the node. This 
  is used to maintain balance during insertion and deletions.
* **Tries**, a tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array of
  keys that are usually strings. The nodes do not store the key 
  associated with that node. Instead, the node's position defines what
  key it is linked to.
* **AVL Trees**, a balanced binary-search tree where the heights of
  the two child subtrees of a given node differ by at most one.
