Usually, I start these posts talking about some unrelated topic, so this time is the fact that 2 weeks ago I was finishing a project I had with Docker and Kubernetes (project I hated btw, definitely I don’t want to work on that field). <br>
And randomly while trying to fix an issue with Docker I completely **murdered my Ubuntu OS**, which means I lost 2 posts I had practically finished, I was just waiting for the right time to post them. <br>
So, I'll have to rewrite them, and I'll post them right away so I don’t lose them again. 

Still, this post is not a rewrite, this is somehow a rage post, a really personal one; with the only purpose to read it in a few years and think "Damn, what a year"<br>
And of course, I'll make it public because YOLO, and as always, I hope someone can feel identified while reading this, and maybe get some good feel out of it. <br>

Because, no matters how hard and lonely it goes, *You're not alone*

Let's see... **Two thousand twenty-two**...

I started this year drunk, making my way back to where I lived, sitting on the snow every ten seconds, thinking if there's a way for me to walk that far. <br>
I stood up and started telling my friend how I always felt like a failure for some personal reason. <br>

Throughout the year this was a recurrent thought on my mind, the fact that when I was 16, I felt like the king of the world, just so young, with so many achievements for that age, **so much potential for a kid**, just ready to come out and make it big! <br>
And what now? Where is that gone? Have I made it big? <br>
That's the thing, have I? Will I? Is it late? <br>
And after thinking about it for many nights, I think I'm not late, but I also think I have to keep going, I can't make the same mistake that 16-year-old kid made, I cannot swallow the story that I'm destined to do great things. Because the fact that I'm good at something doesn't mean I'll be that good forever, if I want great things in the future, **I have to actually make them happen**. <br>
Will I make it? I hope so. <br>
When will I make it? I don't now<br>
Do I have to? Beautifully, I don't have to... It's my life, and whatever I choose is perfectly OK.

What is "making it big" for me? <br> 
Before 2022: Work in some great company, be recognized and remembered.
Right now: Be who I want to be, with the people I want to be, and do the things I want to do. <br>
I don't owe nothing to anyone, and I'll do what I thing is best for me and the people around me, because I'm old enough to take that responsibility to myself.

I had a 2022 in which I promised myself to keep away the people that didn’t add good things to my life, because as of this year, I am tired of being a second choice for everyone, it's just amazing the amount of people I have met since 2017 that wanted me in their lives either because I was their last option, or because they simply needed something from me. <br>

I personally believe I did almost a good job, because I got rid of a lot of people that were harmful for my life, but it's too hard to get rid of everyone. <br>
And if right now you are thinking **"Am I one of those persons?"** Probably you're not, those persons don't care enough about me like to read this...

I spent a year, in which I had to fight one of my greatest fears, which is fighting my problems completely alone, I consider this a great win for my personal growth, but it was just **heartbreaking, depressing and even lonely**. <br>
I used to have a person with whom I could go and talk to, open up and cry about the shit happening to me, this year I lost that, and that made this year especially hard.

By now I have to fight my mind a lot, but it's just really pleasing to notice I react a lot better when bad things happen to me, **I've become a much calmer and less explosive person**, and I'm really proud of myself for that. <br>
Because, trust me, you don't want to be a person who explodes, does everything out of courage and anger, and then sits and cries...<br>
Is just a thousand times better to stay a second thinking about what just happened, and find an adequate reaction. <br>
Some might call that as repressing your feelings, and they're not wrong, but by now, it's the best I can do.

But 2022 were not only bad feelings and loneliness, it's been a year of wins.
When I started this year, I didn't know what I wanted to do after my bachelor degree, and now I don't only know, but I have a plan of where to go, and what to do, and when that plan fails (because it might fail), I kind of know which another plan to take. <br>
When 2022 began, I doubted my skills and capacities, now I trust myself and the way I organize my life, but of course **I always add just a little chaos to my order**. <br>

I made just a couple of friends this year, but I am really happy that all of them seem to be good and balanced people.

It's been a year in which I listened to a lot of music, in order to keep my head busy, but strangely according to YouTube, I didn't listen that much to [**_Of Monsters and Men_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBlKPLeLU_s) or [**_Bastille_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCTDKLjdok4), which usually are my comfort bands. <br> 

But I've also found comfort in another band: [**_Airbag_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdHoMolRiw), taking into consideration I didn't listen to them since 2008, when I lived in my always beautiful Buenos Aires.<br>

Fue un año donde vi a mi segunda patria salir campeona del mundo, donde lloré cada partido de la emoción y el dolor de recordar lo que significó para los argentinos llegar a este mundial del 2022. <br>
Y el alivio que todos sentimos al ver esa hermosa copa volver a Ezeiza, de la mano del **mejor futbolista de la historia**. <br>
Es un sentimiento de mierda que si no entendes, no se lo puede explicar.

I would usually say this was a year to let go and move on, but the pain I've experienced this year and the lessons it gave me; are something that will stay with me forever.<br>
In a balance we could even say it was a year in which **I lost**.

But...

It was a year, that I hope works as an **inflection point in my life**, I believe that the things that happened this year are not as relevant to my life as a whole story, but they mark a beginning to what are going to be 3 very important years in my life. <br>
Because, for me, **_2023 to 2025 will be the years that completely shape my future and my life_**.

I hope that this was a changing year for you as well, although I know in big aspects a year is meaningless, because it's just the way we arrange our calendar, but still, **they were 365 days in which our lives changed**.

**_Happy new year to all._**

Y somos campeones la concha de su madre!!
