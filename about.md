Fur Squared is a furry convention held in Brookfield, WI in February.  For 2021, we're going to be holding a virtual event from February 26 - 28.

### Do I need a VR Headset?

No!  For the [VRChat](https://www.vrchat.com) segments, you can connect with a regular computer, no headset required!

The main content of the convention is going to be streamed on our Youtube page, and we'll be coordinating through [Discord](https://discord.com).
