 There's a lot of good advice here. Work less. Improve your commute. Etc. 


I will tell you something that helped me. So I'm a woman and when I was working in a certain job, I realized I had two problems. First, I took everything personally: decisions I disagreed with made me really angry, errors I made devastated me, feeling excluded put me in a funk, being included made me (I can admit) more than a little cocky. Second, I had very little emotional control. Everyone could read my every mood. I had no poker face. 


I realized that I didn't really matter. I mean, I do great work and lots of people know that, but I knew that if I left, someone else would take my place. My organization just wasn't entitled to all of my energy. My work gets the best of me, my best and most energetic hours, but I need time and energy for myself. It also helped when I left my job, I realized I could excel elsewhere. 


I also learned some emotional self control. I found a confidante (now maybe 5) and shared very selectively. This has really helped me know I could shoot my mouth off in a safe space and gave me a clear line between my bosses and my friends. It's like looking in your wardrobe and seeing work clothes and civilian clothes. There is some overlap but only a little. 


Lastly, I learned a new skill. I asked my boss once if he knew ahead of a big announcement. He said one of the most important things he learned was to never show surprise. Because anything can happen. Now, people ask me all the time. So I know I have it down. 


Oh. And. I am awesome. Every time I slag myself for a mistake, I ask myself why I don't give myself equal congratulations when I do something amazing. I am no imposter, I have real skills.
