 I read once that men say that about women as a tactic to reduce their potential. 

Think about it - when you see middle aged or older men with young women, what do you notice about the power dynamic? It's always in the favor of the man. Younger women TEND not to have identified their voice, or if they have, they're afraid to use it - older women aren't. So by telling women that they've lost their value, some women will believe it and men keep the power. 

The me in my 30s has a zero tolerance for some of the crap that me in my 20s or teens dealt with. Like men telling me that I'm not worth something. Young me would internalize that and feel like crap, and try to earn worthiness. Me now? Nah. Now they get a "I disagree. Sorry you feel that way. I think it's best if you leave." 

Women don't lose their power at 35 - that's about when we come into it. Turns out dudes can't tell the difference, but they know they don't like the way they're treated.
