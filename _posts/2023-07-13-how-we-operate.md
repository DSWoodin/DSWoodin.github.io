## Handyman Work

One free visit to discuss what you want done.

Free written estimate.

Minimum charge for handyman work is Â£50 excluding materials.

We require payment for materials up front.

We won't undertake jobs that would last more than 3 days.

Best efforts to schedule your job within a month and stick to the agreed date.

Cleaning up afterwards is part of the service.

When the work is finished we will invoice you for payment within one month.

We take payments by bank transfer or cheque.

We are privacy-focussed.
