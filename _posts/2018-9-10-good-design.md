  For my example of good design, I have chosen the Williams alumni page from the Williams College website, which can be found at this link: (https://alumni.williams.edu)[https://alumni.williams.edu]. An image of this page is shown below.

![Good Design (Alumni Website)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samzgrunebaum/samzgrunebaum.github.io/master/_posts/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-10%20at%205.01.37%20PM.png)

  I chose this page because it is simple and attractive â€“ moreover, it clearly conveys relevant information to the average user. This page, after all, is meant to be used by Williams alumni to access information that is relevant to alumni regarding Williams and their relationship to the college post-graduation. The central area to the left of the page features three large articles in a similar format to a news website. The menu to the right lists different links to pages that alumni might want to access. Some of these links also have the option to expand the menu with a plus sign. As is expected by the user, a sub-menu drops down when the plus sign is clicked that has more specific options (e.g. "Alumni Directory Login" has the options "Directory Search" and "Profile Update" as links).

  Also, at the top of the page there is a minimal menu with links to the Williams home page, an expandeable master menu for all William College pages, and a search bar. This bar allows the user to navigate out of the page specifically for alumni and back to the main website while also offering the option to navigate to the specific part of the Williams website that they are looking for or search for what they are looking for by keyword. An image of this menu is included below. This is a menu that appears at the top of all Williams pages.

  This makes sense because, while this page is used by Williams alumni, it is also used by Williams to promote various causes for alumni that benefit the school. Featuring these articles engages alumni who may find the articles either personally relevant or simply interesting while also showcasing some of the beneficial things that alumni can do (e.g. be a mentor, volunteer and give back) or things that the school offers for alumni (e.g. off campus events, medals recognizing distinguished alumni). All of these are readily available as links in the menu to the right, or in the case of the featured articles, by clicking on the images or titles to the left. More specific links are available by expanding certain items on the menu to the right. These are all sensible, clearly shown, attractively minimalist design choices that benefit both the alumni who use the website and Williams College. Above all, helping alumni connect with one another seems to be promoted by this website. This makes sense for users who would likely be using the website to check up on things in the Williams community (the most relevant part of which to them would be classmates or people they know) and also makes sense for the college, since the institution benefits in many ways from increased connection between Williams alumni.
  
  Thus, through use of attractive design that emphasizes details that will be most important both to the alumni who would use this page and to Williams College and the many reasons that they wish to keep alumni happy and interested in connecting with other alumni, this page succeeds at clearly and effectively conveying how to access all of the information that it has available.
