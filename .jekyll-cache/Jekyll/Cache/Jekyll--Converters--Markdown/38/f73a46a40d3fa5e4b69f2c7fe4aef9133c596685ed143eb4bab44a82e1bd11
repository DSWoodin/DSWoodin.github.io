<p>Letâ€™s begin</p>

<p><strong><em>Predicting NASDAQ Composite movements using News</em></strong> <a href="https://github.com/anti-mony/NASDAQ-Movement-Prediction"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><br />
I did this project very recently from July-August 2019, where I tried to predict how the NASDAQ Composite index moves based on the news that comes in daily, here is a <a href="">blog</a> for this.<br />
<em><strong>TLDR</strong>: I used RNNs to summarize text and used that to predict +ve/-ve movements of the index, I gathered data from sources online; cleaned and pre-processed it using NLTK and PyTorch for deep learning.</em></p>
