Iâ€™m Musa, a software developer with expertise in iOS Development, currently based in Munich.

Developing mobile apps is more than just a profession to me; it's a passion that extends beyond my work life. I enjoy reading technical material, occasional writing, and working on side projects. Learning and productivity are constant sources of motivation in my life.

<!-- ### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
