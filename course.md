_The Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms_ is a six week interactive course.

**Closed October 26th. Round 2 coming in early 2021. Signup below to get on the waitlist.**

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This is NOT a one size fits all course. It’s also not a one-time solution course as I believe that life is a LIFELONG process of learning and growing. I will promise you, however, that this course will be packed with things you can learn and grow with today and going forward. There will be some things that stick and make you think, some things that may not apply, but you’ll still be able to learn from them.

I'm not an expert, but I have life experience as a mom of four, and journeying along the road to simplifying. I’m just like you, wading through finding myself over the years at home. Welcome to the Simplify Your Home Life: a course for busy moms. I’m so happy to have you here to check this course out to see if it would be good for you!

**ABOUT ME**

I’m a mother of four children - three boys, one toddler girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. I’m a past elementary teacher, turned stay at home, work at home mom seven years ago after I had my second child. I’ve found that the busier I’ve become and as my children age, that it’s become even more important to figure out what is most important to me and us as a family. Living a minimalist lifestyle has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, stronger connections with my people. It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of my home and life. I enjoy helping busy moms simplify home life by learning flexible planning methods + skills. More intention. Seeking less stuff, less to do. And. Always learning and growing.
