<p>Here are a handful of videos that inspired me to get out there, buy a surfboard and surf the Great Lakes.</p>
<h1>Favourites</h1>
<p><strong>#1 On Days Like These We Must</strong> <strong>Surf</strong> - My favourite<strong> </strong>Great Lake surfing video. The message, don't take any day (or wave) for granted.</p>

<p><strong>#2 Step Into Liquid (Surfing Wisconsin Scene)</strong> - A small part from the feature length film Step Into Liquid. The whole movie is worth watching, but this Great Lake Surfing scene holds a special place in my heart. Looking back, I'm pretty sure this was the first ever footage I saw of surfing in the lakes. Don't expect to see any nice waves or gnarly turns, but you will see that "the stoke is global".</p>

<p><strong>#3 Globe and Mail Short</strong> - A good short from the Globe and Mail on board shaping and surfing in the lakes.</p>

<p><strong>#4 Red Bull Surfing in the Great Lakes</strong> - Just some awesome footage from superior. Proof that it can get real in the lakes.</p>

<h1><strong>Honourable mentions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Step Into Liquid (Tanker Surfing Texas Scene)</strong> - It may not be on a lake, but you see the same obscure passion.</p>

<p><strong>Kelly Slaters Perfect Wave</strong> - Once they start making more of these, we will be able to catch perfect waves anywhere...</p>
