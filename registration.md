Entry into the lottery will last until Sunday, January 9 at 11:59pm central.&nbsp; Assuming there are more than 50 people interested in the poster tier, 50 random people will be picked, and announced on Monday, January 10.&nbsp; On that date, emails with special registration upgrade links will be sent out.&nbsp; The price for the Poster tier is $200.&nbsp; Your cost will be the difference between that and what you paid for your existing badge.
