  <i> *Excited about the future of engineering* </i>
</div>


My name is Panteleimon Angelidis. I am one of the Co-Founders of *factual*, a startup building NLP software solutions for validated information and I work as a Data Engineer Consultant @Deloitte.

I am a graduate of Finance at the University of Macedonia, with the distinction of the 4th highest grade in the acceptance list. In my experience as a student, I participated in business organizations, sport competitions and I've been a Research fellow in a couple of academic projects. I've been a Research fellow in the private sector, in the industry of Corporate Valuation, where I had the opportunity to mathematically model valuations of financial institutions.

As a part of CVM Laboratory of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I worked in modeling Cryptocurrency Asset prices. Such a task has been demanding, since those assets are characterized with volatility. Deep learning techniques had to be used to face the problem. Google's TFT has been one of the main models that proved optimized results for such timeseries.
