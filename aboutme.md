My name is Alex Leu, and this is what I do!

- I've recently started working in the Optimization Lab team at AdRoll, Inc as a
  Data Scientist.
- I've recently developed an interest in shiny, and R markdown.
- I also like to run. 
- I like to play guitar, beatbox, and sing!

### my interest
I am a natural science life long learner who had recently discovered the beauty
of computer science. I started coding on my first job in sales operation,
thought man daily tasks could be automated with programming, and the
ultimate result of automation leads me to the world of computational statistic,
aka data science.

Having to have this picture in mind, I was intrigued by this challenge to create
an ideal world into reality. I started off with writing scripts and apps that
improved my  work efficiency, and that led to codes that improved
the entire team's daily tasks. As I moved from the operational to
the BI side, I became even more fascinated by how data science could be utilized
to impact business models.

My passion is to create and optimize data algorithms that not only replace
manual nodes with intelligent data driven quality, but also drive up the full
data stream to make the best business executive decisions.

### my history

I graduated from UCLA back in 2014 in Biophysics.

I worked as a contractor at Google back in 2014-2016 as a Business Intelligence
Devleoper.
