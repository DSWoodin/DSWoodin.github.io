 This. Men act like it's soooo hard to compliment women because we're so oversensitive about what they say, but they say shit that is obviously disgusting and act all confused when women don't like it  
It's really not that hard guys. You don't need a reddit thread to figure out that telling a random woman you want to see her naked is gross and unwelcome
