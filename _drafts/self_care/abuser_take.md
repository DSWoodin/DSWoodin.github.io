 I am the abuser. Its terrible all the way around but mostly for the one being abused. I am getting help because if I don't I will lose the love of my life and I need it because I am slowly destroying him. Most of it comes from my abuse I endured and the help I didn't seek before for my anger issues. I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive myself for some of the things I have done or said but I am hoping that with change the forgiveness will come as well. I am hoping I can change. Most of the time I feel trapped in a brain that isn't mine and hate myself for it. 

I'm sure I will hear lots of things about my partner would be better off leaving me,  etc..and these are things I know. I'm grateful for the chance to change and wouldn't blame him if he did leave.
